### Wax poetic about how Lizardfolk are the best in the world, and the followers of the gret plan. But what makes us oh so incredible?

## The Corruption of the Nexus Description: "The geomantic web, once a conduit of the Old Ones' power, now pulses with unnatural energy. The Chaos-tainted nexus stones glow with an eerie light, driving the skink priests into wild visions. The temple cities are abuzz with debate—should this new power be embraced or exorcised?"

### 2. Feral Spawnings Description: "The spawning pools have produced something... strange. The newly born warriors are larger and more aggressive, but their minds seem clouded by primal instincts. They claw and hiss at even their kin, causing unease among the skink attendants. Are these spawnings a gift from the gods, or a curse of the Chaos taint?"

### A slann has entered a meditative trance, warning of terrible things to come. Are these genuine visions, or the whispers of chaos at work?

### The Jungle Hungers Description: "The once-lush jungles surrounding the temple cities have grown restless, twisting into unnatural shapes. Wild beasts infused with chaotic power stalk the shadows, attacking both settlers and warriors alike. The skinks report that the jungle itself seems alive with malice."

### The Old Ones' Test Description: "A sacred temple deep within the jungle has suddenly activated, its walls glowing with celestial glyphs.

### Mutant Spawning has resulted in a massive Sauron, stronger and powerful with shimmering scales. He is a natural born leader, but his rhetoric is borderline heretical. What should we do?
