 albion_rally_the_clans_title:0 "Then it must be War"
 albion_rally_the_clans_desc:0 "“Albion—an ancient and mist-shrouded land, a damp island primarily characterized by its heather-cloaked moors where the wind howls and the gray mountains loom cold and imposing. From the few surviving ancient records, it is apparent that they had, at one point, dealings with a far technologically superior Elder Race. Early scholars in the field have suggested it was with the Elves, however the presence of very few Elven artifacts on the island, especially when compared to Bretonnia or the in the Empire, have led recent scholars to propose it was with the Saurians.”\n\n“The consolidation of the Albionese clans, at the time of His Imperial Majesty, Karl Franz I Holswig Schliestein, is a fascinating piece of their history. For millennia prior, after the contact with that elder race abruptly ended, the isolation created by the mists surrounding the Island led the clans of Albion to degenerate into inbred barbarism on par with the Savage Orcs. 'Organized' into extremely loose confederations of small groups, often led by the strongest or most respected member. This fragmentation and isolation rendered the establishment of any centralized authority nearly impossible throughout much of their history.”\n\n“However, this suddenly shifted with the weakening of the fog in the early 26th century, as Albion had lost its natural protection, external threats grew rapidly, and a series of profane Norscan warlords struck. With the rapid urgency to defend their ancestral lands, a shift began to take place. Under the guidance of a series of wise leaders such as Eldra and her kin, the clans found themselves compelled to adopt a more unified and cooperative form of governance. This emerging solidarity, unprecedented in Albion’s history, would bring about significant and far-reaching consequences.”\n— Imperial Scholar Gerhardt von Richstein, Chronicles of the Forgotten Isles"
