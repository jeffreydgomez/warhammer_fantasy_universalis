 archaon_begin_the_journey_desc:0 "The will of the Dark Gods beckons Archaon westward. It is not mere chance nor blind fate that guides his path, but the designs of the Ruinous Powers themselves. While lesser champions throw themselves into the meat grinder of eternal war, seeking gifts they cannot comprehend, Archaon marches with purpose. He will not be a mindless beast, a broken thing twisted beyond reason, nor a plaything for capricious gods. His will burns like a brand in the maelstrom, a flame that even the Dark Gods would rather savor than snuff out. The path ahead leads to the Altar of Darkness, where his destiny awaits."

 flavor_archaon.0.d:0 "I've damned everyone and everything I've ever loved, and I still feel no remorse. No shame, no pity.\n\nOnce, I was a Templar of Sigmar. Once, I knelt in prayer before the 'gods' of the Empire, cut down countless numbers of their enemies, sought wisdom in the ancient tomes hidden beneath their temples. I was marked for greatness—Grandmaster of my order, perhaps something even greater.\n\nThen came the night that shattered my world. The Liber Caelestior, heretical texts of Necrodomo the Insane, lay before me, their flesh-bound pages whispering secrets of doom. I read each line in a frenzy, my blood turning to ice. The Everchosen’s life was my life. Every trial, every hardship—it was all foretold.\n\nI tried to speak Sigmar’s name, but the words turned to dust in my mouth. The light left my breath. My faith—my life—was a lie. Ulric, Sigmar… mere masks of cruel and distant powers who care not for mortals. I had given them everything, and in return, they left me with silence as cold and vast as the grave. In that moment, I embraced the truth. I burned my temple to the ground. I cast aside the name I stole, and embraced the only one that is truly mine.\n\nArchaon.\n\nThe prophecy of the Everchosen is written in the blood of fools and the ashes of empires. I have gathered a warband of Chaos Warriors—the Swords of Chaos. To seize my destiny, I must claim the six great artifacts of Chaos, proving my worth to the Ruinous Powers.\nThe gods have set a path before me. I will carve my name into history with fire and steel."
