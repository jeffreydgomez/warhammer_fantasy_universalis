dark_elf_events.1.d:0 "The dream of reclaiming Ulthuan has never faded from the hearts of the Druchii. The Phoenix Throne, stolen by the weak and decadent Asur, rightfully belongs to the true masters of elvenkind. For centuries, we have sharpened our blades and steeled our resolve, waiting for the opportune moment to strike. Now, with our fleets strong and our armies numerous, the nobles demand action—our banners must fly over the White Tower of Hoeth, and our warriors must set Lothern aflame.\n\nYet war is not so simple. The Asur will fight bitterly for their homeland, and the Phoenix King will summon all his strength to repel us. Even now, spies report the movements of Ulthuan’s armies, and the decision to launch a full-scale invasion could determine our fate. Will we rally our warriors and carve a bloody path across the island, or shall we delay and risk the ire of our nobles? Strength is everything, and hesitation could mean death."

A powerful noble, backed by a cabal of discontented lords, has declared that our rule is weak and that only by replacing us can Naggaroth reach its full potential. The court watches closely, for among our people, treason and greatness are often the same thing. Do we strike preemptively and assert our dominance, or do we risk being seen as weak by acknowledging the challenger’s claim?\n\nTo falter in the face of a usurper would be to invite death. The Witch King himself watches this struggle with amusement, knowing that only the most ruthless may rule. If we refuse to act, our rival’s influence will only grow, and soon, their challenge will become open war. Do we prepare for a brutal contest of blades and sorcery, or do we trust in our own strength to weather the storm?"

dark_elf_events.3.t:0 "Shades from the Shadowlands"  
dark_elf_events.3.d:0 "From the ice-caked wilderness of the Shadowlands, the Shades have come. These masterful assassins and trackers live far from the courts and cities of Naggaroth, dwelling in exile among the bitter peaks. They have returned not out of loyalty, but because they scent opportunity. Their daggers are sharp, their arrows swift, and they claim they can kill our enemies before they ever see their doom approaching. But such allies are never truly trustworthy.\n\nThe Shades ask for gold and blood, a price paid in coin and in the lives of our foes. Yet many whisper that their loyalty is as fleeting as the winter wind, and that a foolish ruler who welcomes them too readily may soon find themselves with a knife between their ribs. Do we risk hiring these ruthless killers, hoping their skills outweigh their treachery, or do we turn them away and seek more reliable means of dealing death?"  
dark_elf_events.3.a:0 "What’s the worst that could happen?"

dark_elf_events.4.title:0 "A Slaaneshi Cult Emerges"  
dark_elf_events.4.desc:0 "Even among the cruel-hearted Druchii, there are those who crave excess beyond all reason. The taint of the Dark Prince is insidious, slipping through the cracks of our society like perfume on the wind. A cult has emerged in secret, their whispered prayers to Slaanesh growing bolder with each passing night. If left unchecked, their decadent corruption will spread like rot, infecting our warriors and nobles alike until discipline and ruthlessness give way to hedonistic madness.\n\nThe question is not whether they should be eradicated, but how. The Witch Elves would see them flayed alive, while the Black Guard suggests a quieter purge to avoid unnecessary unrest. Yet there are those who argue that these cultists may have their uses—after all, who better to wield the gifts of Chaos than those strong enough to resist them? Do we crush them utterly, or do we seek to turn this chaos to our advantage?"  
dark_elf_events.4.a:0 "Burn the cultists to the ground!"

dark_elf_events.5.title:0 "Birth of a Mage"  
dark_elf_events.5.desc:0 "Among the Druchii, magic is a power both revered and feared. A child has demonstrated an innate connection to the Winds of Magic, her sorcery manifesting in strange and powerful ways. Already, her presence unsettles those around her—lesser beings who sense that she is destined for something greater. Yet the path of a sorceress is not easily chosen. Will she walk the halls of Ghrond, where Morathi’s teachings will shape her into a mistress of death and destruction, or shall she take a different path?\n\There are those who argue that she should be trained for war, wielding her power on the battlefield rather than in the treacherous courts of sorcery. Others whisper that the decision should be left to fate—if she is truly worthy, she will find her own destiny. No matter what choice is made, one thing is certain - power is never given freely among the Druchii—it is taken."  
dark_elf_events.5.a:0 "She shall train to be a Sorceress of Ghrond."

dark_elf_events.6.title:0 "Intrigue in the Court"  
dark_elf_events.6.desc:0 "One of our diplomats has stumbled upon a piece of dangerous knowledge—an indiscretion, a secret alliance, or perhaps something even more sinister. In the courts of Naggaroth, information is as deadly as steel, and the right knowledge in the wrong hands can topple kingdoms. He now stands before us, waiting for instructions. Should he turn this information into a weapon, striking down an enemy before they strike first?\n\nYet there are some who argue that such petty scheming is beneath us. True power does not rely on blackmail, but on absolute domination. If we choose the high road, we may earn the grudging respect of our allies—though such respect means little among the Druchii. Will we wield this information as a dagger in the dark, or prove that our power is absolute, with or without such tricks?"  
dark_elf_events.6.a:0 "Blackmail, of course."

In [event_target.GetName], the wretched thralls have risen, armed with stolen blades and reckless fury. Their desperation makes them dangerous, and if left unchecked, their defiance could inspire other slaves to rise against their rightful masters. The nobility demands swift and merciless retribution, lest we show any sign of weakness.\n\nYet there are those who see opportunity in the rebellion. Let the slaves believe they have a chance at victory—only to crush them when they least expect it, their broken bodies serving as a lesson to all who would dare defy us. Or perhaps it would be amusing to let them rampage for a time, sowing further chaos among the weak before we put them back in chains. The path forward is clear. The only question is how much sport we will make of their suffering."

Once hailed as Ulthuan’s champion, betrayal by the High Elf nobility and the fires of Asuryan forged you into what they feared most - the true ruler of our kind.\n\nIn the cold expanse of Naggaroth, the Druchii flourish while the Asur decline. Yet your realm is fractured. The great cities—Morathi’s Ghrond, savage Karond Kar, the altars of Har Ganeth, the schemers of Hag Graef, and the shipwrights of Clar Karond—each pursue their own designs. The estates grow restless, ever hungry for influence.\n\nMorathi’s Cult of Pleasure spreads unchecked, her power vast, her ambition veiled in silk and sorcery. She aids your rule—but she also undermines it.\n\nStill, you must endure. Your throne lies not in Naggaroth, but across the sea. Ulthuan awaits its true king. We shall take it—by blood, fire, and will unbroken."

dark_elf_events.200.d:0 "The Cult of Pleasure—Morathi’s blasphemous legacy—has festered like a beautiful poison in the heart of our society for centuries. Beneath its velvet masks and perfumed incense lie blood-soaked altars, ecstatic rituals, and whispers of the Dark Prince, Slaanesh. It has ensnared nobles with promises of immortality, corrupted sorceresses with visions of perfection, and dulled the blades of our ambition with hollow pleasures.\n\nAnd yet, this cult has not merely weakened us—it has also granted power. Its rituals swell the Winds of Magic, its influence stokes the fires of ambition, and its decadence has shaped a culture of exquisite cruelty that terrifies our enemies. Now, the veil has been lifted, and we hold dominion over its temples, rites, and leaders.\n\nThe question stands before us like a blade at the throat of our destiny: Do we burn this heresy from our realm, purging every trace of Slaaneshi corruption in fire and blood? Do we shackle it, bending its secrets and seductions to the will of the Witch King? Or do we fully embrace it, casting aside caution and letting its unholy allure guide us toward a darker, more transcendent dominion? One path leads to purity, another to control, and the last to oblivion—or glory."

Hers is a name whispered with both reverence and dread, for none can deny her mastery over sorcery, seduction, and manipulation.\n\nThrough the centuries, her Cult of Pleasure has wormed its way into every corner of Naggaroth, corrupting hearts, unraveling loyalties, and staining the land with shadow. Now, with her cult shattered and her ambitions checked, she stands diminished—but not defeated. Bound in chains of black iron, her mind as dangerous as ever, she looks upon us not with fear, but with scornful curiosity.\n\nShall we execute her, risking the wrath of her hidden loyalists and the arcane secrets she alone commands? Shall we imprison her, hoping she does not twist her cage into a throne? Or shall we, in a moment of peril or pragmatism, call upon her power once more? The future of Naggaroth may yet be shaped by the fate we choose for the Queen of Mysteries."
