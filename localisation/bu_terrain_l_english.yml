 urban_terrain_desc:0 "Urban terrain is heavy infrastructure and densely-packed provinces dominated by buildings and streets. Provinces with urban terrain have historically succeeded on their own merit instead of being just another city in a larger realm. Prominent city-states can be counted amongst these, in addition to cities that can or have historically had a great deal of wealth and political weight against their overlord."

 temple_city_terrain_desc:0 "Temple City terrain is a fortified stronghold of the Lizardmen, marked by large scale constructions of pyramids, ziggurats and temples."

 dwarf_karak_desc:0 "A Dwarf Karak is a type of multi-level hold, or fortress-city. They were typically built around a crucial mining resource that would dominate the trade and economy of that settlement. The Karaks were mostly built during the Golden age of the Dwarves; many of them were lost to Greenskins and Skaven during the subsequent wars that followed afterward. Every Karak was ruled over by a King who swore fealty to the High King of Karaz-A-Karak."

 underway_desc:0 "The Underway is a vast inter-continental network of roads and highways built by the ancient Dwarven Empire. The majority of these highways fell to the skaven and greenskins when they each invaded the Empire in days of old. It is called the 'Ungdrin Ankor' by the Dwarves."
 
 cavern_desc:0 "These caverns are a deep region within the mountains. They are rarely traversed and only utilized for mushroom harvesting or mining."

 great_maze_desc:0 "The Great Maze is the name the Skaven have given to their immensely vast underground network of tunnels they have dug themselves. The Skaven Under-Empire specializes in moving around underground so they can access warpstone mines, infiltrate Dwarven holds or the Underway, or to establish an Under-City beneath a major population centre. The number of skaven tunnels that constitute the Great Maze are uncountable and unknown; and more are always being dug."

 magical_forest_terrain_desc:0 "Magical Forest terrain are ancient forests steeped in magic. Just who is allowed to remain in the forests' interior is the will of the trees themselves and their spirit allies."

 wasteland_desc:0  "Wasteland is land that has undergone catastrophic damage, often leaving it lifeless."

 galleons_graveyard_terrain_desc:0 "The Galleon's Graveyard is a magical location full of the undead and the focal point of the sea phenomenom known as 'The Maelstrom'. It is said the undead are able to rise from the depths of the deep seas to serve in the fleets of their vampiric masters. Count Noctilus has made this location his home, utilizing the Maelstrom to supplement his naval forces."

 isle_of_the_dead_terrain_desc:0 "The Isle of the dead is a small archipelago located at the center of the Ulthuan's Inner Sea. It is the focal point of the Great Vortex, from which all magic from the Ream of Chaos flows into the world of Mallus. A series of Polar Gates built by the Old ones aroud the isle siphon that magic to prevent the sinking of Ulthuan and the destruction of the world by Chaos corruption."

 skjold_desc:0 "Skjold is the traditional capital of the Bjornlings. It sits high on a cliff above the Sea of Claws. Despite being Norscan, foreigners are tolerated here more than other locations in Norsca and there is a regular coming and going of traders and reavers. The ruler of the tribe reigns from the King's Hall, a tall single-story building covered with intricate carvings and entered into by two large, painted doors. The port sits at the base of the cliff, reached by stone stairs carved into the rock."

 mountain_pass_desc:0 "Mountain passes are scattered throughout the world, providing an easier means of travel through the regions in which they are found. They are slightly more habitable than the mountain peaks themselves, as well."

 warren_city_desc:0 "Warren-Cities, oftentimes called Undercities, are massive, hidden, overpopulated ratmen metropoli. They are typically found deep underneath the foundations of the cities of surface-dwellers, or built over the ruins of a subterranean city of the Dwarven Empire. Occasionally they are built by the skaven themselves away from the settlements of others in order to take advantage of warpstone deposits or other resources in an area. These cities are full of mutating diseases, rabid cannibalism, devastating warp magic, along with some of the most innovative feats of engineering ever to be conceived."

 ruins_desc:0 "All that remains here are the ruins of a once-great city, temple or fortress. While still habitable, this once-urban environment is not as capable as it once was and offers only a slight defense against attackers. Due to the obvious unappeal of living in a ruined location it is not easy to find recruits for the local garrison."

 zanbaijin_desc:0 "Zanbaijin"

 frigid_mountains_desc:0 "These mountains exist in an eternal state of snowstorm, avalanche and ice-winds. Only the most durable of denizens are capable of surviving in such harsh environs."

 frozen_forest_desc:0 "These frozen forests are permanently in a state of cold and ice. It is likely the primary growth of these forests occurred in a warmer age long ago, and if any growth at all still occurs it is during the few warm weeks of the summer each year."
