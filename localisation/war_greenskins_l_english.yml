### Flavor Pulse Events

greenskin_events.1.t:0 "A New Warboss Rises"
greenskin_events.1.d:0 "Da Warboss ain't lookin' so strong anymore, and some of da boyz are thinkin' it might be time for a new boss to take over. Rumors are spreadin' that the Warboss is losin' his touch, and there's plenty of gits eyein' his throne. If da Warboss ain't careful, he'll find himself on the wrong end of a choppa. It could be chaos, but maybe this is da greenskin way."
greenskin_events.1.a:0 "I'm da boss."
greenskin_events.1.b:0 "I'm outta here."
greenskin_events.1.c:0 "Let 'im try! Get the choppa!"

greenskin_events.2.t:0 "Squigs Gone Wild"
greenskin_events.2.d:0 "A herd of squigs has gotten loose! They're rampaging through da camp, chomping on boyz, grots, and anything else that gets in their way. Da squigs ain't stoppin' for nothin', tearin' up tents, wagons, and even some gobbos stupid enough to get too close. It’s chaos, but also... kinda funny. Maybe we can put this to good use, or just enjoy the madness!"
greenskin_events.2.a:0 "Round 'em up!"
greenskin_events.2.b:0 "Eat 'em up!"

greenskin_events.3.t:0 "Not Enough Loot"
greenskin_events.3.d:0 "Da boyz never have enough loot, and they’re startin’ to look at their own places for da shiny stuff. Gobbos are hiding their treasures, and orks are breakin' into their huts. Da camp is about to turn into a free-for-all unless we find a way to calm things down. Should we let 'em have at it, pay 'em off, or distract 'em with somethin' shinier elsewhere?"
greenskin_events.3.a:0 "Pay 'em off."
greenskin_events.3.b:0 "Let 'em loot!"
greenskin_events.3.c:0 "Find somethin' else to do!"

greenskin_events.4.t:0 "Troll Trouble"
greenskin_events.4.d:0 "A bunch of trolls in da Waaagh! are causin' trouble. Dey’re eatin’ da gobbos, pukin’ all over da camp, and refusin’ to listen to da Big Boss. These slimy gits are too dumb to know when to stop, and now they’re messin’ up da plans for da next big scrap. What should we do about it? Let da trolls have their way, or kick da stinkin’ beasts outta da camp for good?"
greenskin_events.4.a:0 "Nuthin! Gobbos can be good eatin"
greenskin_events.4.b:0 "Kick 'em out."
greenskin_events.4.c:0 "And kick out anybody eatin' gobbos!"

greenskin_events.5.t:0 "Trial by Combat"
greenskin_events.5.d:0 "Da boyz want da Big Boss in da fightin’ pits! Dey wanna see you take on some of da toughest gits around to prove you’re da strongest and meanest boss in da land. Dis could be a chance to show 'em how great you are—or it could be da end of your rule. If you go in, there’s no backin’ out, and da fight will decide your fate. Are you ready to prove yourself?"
greenskin_events.5.a:0 "Nah"
greenskin_events.5.b:0 "Yah!"

greenskin_events.6.t:0 "Border Raiding"
greenskin_events.6.d:0 "Da boyz are restless and want to do some light raiding across da border. Dey say da humies next door are soft, and their villages are just waitin’ to be looted. It won’t be long before someone starts swingin' their choppa whether you approve or not. Let ‘em have their fun and upset da neighbors, or tell ‘em to hold back and keep da peace—for now."
greenskin_events.6.a:0 "Not right now."
greenskin_events.6.b:0 "Go right ahead."


greenskin_events.7.t:0 "Da Slaves Is Back!"
greenskin_events.7.d:0 "Da boyz came back wiv a whole mess o’ groanin', moanin' slaves from dere last raid. Dey dragged 'em in by da dozen – stunties, humies, even some pointy-ears, all lookin' scared an' smellin’ funny.\n\nNow we gotta figger out wot to do wiv 'em. Smash ‘em into da dirt makin’ shiny stuff? Sell ‘em to them dodgy gits wot run da markets? Or maybe chuck ‘em in da choppa lines and see if dey can hold a spear straight."

greenskin_events.7.option_1:0 "Put 'em to work! Da mines need screamin'."
greenskin_events.7.option_2:0 "Sell 'em off! We ain't got da grub for dis many mouths."
greenskin_events.7.option_3:0 "Give ‘em a stick, shove ‘em in da front lines!"

greenskin_events.8.t:0 "Gork or Mork?"
greenskin_events.8.desc:0 "A bigg'un of a shaman, mad as a bag o’ squigs, come screamin’ outta da mountains sayin’ we gotta choose: Gork or Mork. 'One is da god o’ smashin’ face,' he sez, 'and da other is da god of kickin’ teeth – but clever-like!'\n\nNow da tribe’s all shoutin’ and bashin’ over which one’s boss. Dey both sound proper orcy, but da shaman sez pickin’ one’ll make us stronger… or maybe just make da shamans happy."
greenskin_events.8.a:0 "Mork of course! (Wait, is that Gork?)"
greenskin_events.8.b:0 "Gork, certainly! (Wait, that looks a lot like Mork.)"
greenskin_events.8.c:0 "I dunno. You decide, ya weird smelly gitz."
greenskin_events.8.d:0 "Shut it, shaman! We don’t answer to no beardy loony!"

greenskin_events.9.t:0 "Da Big Parade"
greenskin_events.9.d:0 "Some o' da lads seen humie armies marchin’ about in shiny lines, bangin’ drums an’ lookin’ smug. So now some git sez we should do a 'parade' too. Dunno wot it means, but it sounds like shoutin, marchin', and maybe bashin'.\n\nProblem is, orcs don’t like bein’ told wot to do in neat lines. Dis could either be a show of our might… or end up wiv boyz choppin’ each other in da face over who goes first."

greenskin_events.9.a:0 "Get in line, ya maggots! We’re on parade!"
greenskin_events.9.b:0 "Biggest WAAAGH! march evah! Bring da squigs too!"
greenskin_events.9.c:0 "Nah, just shove a bunch o’ orcs together till sumfin dies."

greenskin_events.10.t:0 "Da Talky Squig"
greenskin_events.10.d:0 "One night, a big squig wandered into camp, but dis one ain’t right. It talks. Real clear, like a humie scholar, and it says stuff like 'governance' and 'agricultural surplus'. It’s smarter than most bosses, and that makes some boyz nervous.\n\nShamans say it’s cursed or blessed or maybe both. Da big question is – do we krump it, or listen to what it’s got to say ‘bout runnin’ da tribe? Or maybe, just maybe… we get smarter by bitin’ it?"

greenskin_events.10.a:0 "Kill it! Too many words, not enough chompin’!"
greenskin_events.10.b:0 "Hmm… tell me more ‘bout tax structure, mister squig."
greenskin_events.10.c:0 "Interesting… maybe it knows how to build bigger boomsticks."



## Mission Events

greenskin_events.100.t:0 "Our City Was Sacked"
greenskin_events.100.d:0 "The once-thriving streets now lie in flames, their former splendor reduced to smoldering wreckage. Fires rage, smoke billows into the sky, and the cries of the wounded echo through the devastation. Looters pick through the shattered remains of homes and temples, while the stench of death hangs heavy in the air. The enemy came like a tide of destruction, and though they have now departed, they have left nothing but sorrow and ruin in their wake. It will take years to recover from this calamity—if we ever do."
greenskin_events.100.a:0 "A dark day for our people..."

### Personal Freedom Event
greenskin_events.101.t:0 "Wot's Dis About Freedum?"
greenskin_events.101.d:0 "Some of da boyz been yammerin' about wantin' more 'freedum' or sumthin'. They say they don’t wanna get bashed on da head jus' for speakin' up or runnin' away from a fight every now and den. Frankly, it sounds pretty weak, but some of da smarter gitz reckon lettin' 'em blow off steam might stop 'em from gettin' too rowdy.\n\nStill, givin' greenskins 'freedum' sounds a bit too much like wot da humies do, an' we all know they're a buncha soft gitz. Maybe it's best we stick to da good ol' bashin' an' shoutin' methods dat have worked so far. Or, who knows, maybe lettin' 'em rant a bit might keep 'em from stabbin' each other in da back. Decisions, decisions…"
greenskin_events.101.a:0 "Shut 'em up! Freedum's fer weak gitz!"
greenskin_events.101.b:0 "Eh, let 'em yell a bit. Might make 'em think better."

### Army Reform Event
greenskin_events.102.t:0 "Fightin' Proppa"
greenskin_events.102.d:0 "Some of da bossier boyz been sayin' we needz a plan for fightin'! Dey been jabberin' about 'strategy' an' 'formashuns' instead of just runnin' at da enemy wiv choppas swingin'. Sounds like a lotta thinkin' fer not much bashin', but maybe dere's sumthin' to it.\n\nOn da uvver hand, all dis marchin' in lines an' waitin' for orders could take da fun outta things. After all, a good WAAAGH! ain't about finkin'—it's about smashin'! Maybe we should just let da boyz loose an' see who hits da hardest. Or, maybe try this 'organizin'' lark an' see if it makes da krumpin' better."
greenskin_events.102.a:0 "WAAAGH! Charge 'em!"
greenskin_events.102.b:0 "Oi, you lot! Form a... wot's it called... a line or sumthin'!"

### Government Reform Event
greenskin_events.103.t:0 "Too Many Rulez"
greenskin_events.103.d:0 "Da uvver lotz got rulez an' stuff! Dey got laws, councilz, an' all sorts of fancy ideas about how to run a kingdom. Sounds dead borin', but maybe a few rulez could keep da boyz from bashin' each uvver too much—at least until da next WAAAGH!.\n\nDen again, why bother wiv rulez when we could just arm everyone wiv bigger choppas and let 'em sort it out da proppa way? Stability's overrated anyway, an' if everyone’s fightin’, den no one's complainin'. Still, might be worth considerin' sum kind of order, even if it’s just to keep da gobbos from nickin' all da loot."
greenskin_events.103.a:0 "Rule numba one - Moar fightin'!"
greenskin_events.103.b:0 "Maybe a few rulez ain't so bad... if it gets us a bigger WAAAGH!"


### War Reform Event
greenskin_events.104.t:0 "WAAAGH or Nah?"
greenskin_events.104.d:0 "Sum of da brainier boyz been wonderin' if WAAAGH is da best way. Dey been mutterin' about 'alternatives' like buildin' museumz or banks—whatever da zog those are. Sounds like a lotta muckin' about for not much krumpin', but if it keeps da boyz busy between fightin', maybe it ain't all bad.\n\nStill, why waste time on all dat when we could just make da fightin' more fun? Bloodsports, bashin' contests, and daily scrapz sound like a much better use of time. After all, greenskins ain't known for readin' books or countin' teef unless it's how many ya knocked out!"
greenskin_events.104.a:0 "More WAAAGH! More smashy bits!"
greenskin_events.104.b:0 "Fine, we'll try da fancy buildin' stuff... but wiv spikes on it!"

### Economy Reform Event
greenskin_events.105.t:0 "Shiny Bitz or Work?"
greenskin_events.105.d:0 "Do we nick da shiny bitz or try dis 'work' thing da humies keep jabberin' about? Work sounds borin', but if it means more loot in da long run, maybe it ain't so bad. Some of da gobbos say we should start diggin' fer shiny bitz an' chargin' uvver gitz for stuff, like da stunties do.\n\nDen again, nickin' shiny bitz right now sounds a lot better than waitin' fer it to pile up. Workin's fer gitz anyway, an' not bashin' heads fer loot sounds downright un-Orky. Maybe we just need to krump some more humie cities an' take der shiny bitz instead!"
greenskin_events.105.a:0 "Nick da shiny bitz! Work's fer gitz!"
greenskin_events.105.b:0 "Fine, we'll try dis 'investin'' stuff... but only if we get more shiny bitz later!"

### Faction Favor Event
greenskin_events.106.t:0 "Da Bestest Greenskins"
greenskin_events.106.d:0 "Orcs, Gobbos, an' Hobgobbos all want da boss’s favor. Orcs are da biggest and da meanest, but dey can get outta hand if ya don’t keep 'em busy smashin' stuff. Gobbos are sneaky an' clever, but tend to leg it when da fightin' gets too rough. Hobgobbos, on da uvver hand, got fancy hats an' ridez, but dey ain't happy unless dey’re swimmin' in loot.\n\nGivin' one lot da boss’s favor might make da uvverz mad, but tryin' to keep 'em all 'appy sounds like too much finkin'. Maybe it's best to pick da toughest or da sneakiest an' krump anyone who don’t like it. Or just tell 'em all to shut up an' fight, which is always a solid choice."
greenskin_events.106.option_1:0 "Da biggest and da meanest! Orcs all da way!"
greenskin_events.106.option_2:0 "Da sneakiest lot! Gobbos is useful... sometimes."
greenskin_events.106.option_3:0 "Hobgobbos got pointy hats and fancy ridez! Might be worth it."
greenskin_events.106.option_4:0 "No favorites! You'z all gitz anyway!"
