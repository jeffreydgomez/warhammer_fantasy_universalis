The world will either bow before us or burn in defiance.  \n\nYet power is never unchallenged. Should we falter, should our enemies rally and drive us back, the spell will be broken. If we taste the bitterness of defeat, the fires that fuel our conquest will wane, and the moment will pass. This is our time. A time to strike, to carve our name into history, to become a legend that the world will never forget. We must not fail."
