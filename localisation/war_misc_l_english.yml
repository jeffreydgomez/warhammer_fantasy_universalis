Our warriors stand ready, our banners rise in every land we claim, and the earth trembles beneath our advance. \n\nFor decades, the world dismissed us as fractured and weak, an afterthought in the great struggles of empires. That illusion is shattered. We have become a force that cannot be ignored, expanding with a speed and ferocity that defies all expectation. No walls are high enough, no armies vast enough to halt our storm. As long as victory remains ours, our momentum is unbreakable. The world will either bow before us or burn in defiance.  \n\nYet power is never unchallenged. Should we falter, should our enemies rally and drive us back, the spell will be broken. If we taste the bitterness of defeat, the fires that fuel our conquest will wane, and the moment will pass. This is our time. A time to strike, to carve our name into history, to become a legend that the world will never forget. We must not fail."
