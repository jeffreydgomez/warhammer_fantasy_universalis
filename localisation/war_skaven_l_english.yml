They gather their followers, calling for your downfall.\n\nWhat will you do, great one? Will you crush them beneath your claw-paw and prove to all who is master? Or maybe-maybe you let them have throne for now... only to take-take it back later, yes-yes? Or will you fight-fight it out in a glorious display of Skaven treachery?"

They claim weaklings live on the surface and that they can bring back spoils-riches if we let them.\n\nBut raids cost lives, resources, yes-yes! If we let them go, maybe they win-win and bring glory-power to the clan—or maybe they fail-fail and weaken us all! Will we risk letting these fools leave-leave? Or keep them working here, where they are less likely to die-stupid?"

We cannot reach it unless we destroy-collapse the warren and displace all who live there.\n\nWhat do we do, mighty ruler? Should we blast-blast through and take the warpstone immediately? Or should we wait, hoping for an even bigger-better deposit to reveal itself nearby? Or maybe-maybe... leave it alone entirely? But who would do such a thing, yes-yes?"

skaven.7.d:0 "Warpstone is power-power! But also, twist-bane for the foolish-weak! Some of our rats are eating-snorting too much warpstone, yes-yes. In [province_name], their minds twist-warp, and some are collapsing from the strain. Productivity suffers, but they are stronger and more dangerous in combat.\n\nShould we let them keep consuming warpstone, yes-yes? Or stop them and stabilize the situation? Or perhaps... let them do whatever they want and watch what happens? Choose wisely, great ruler!"
