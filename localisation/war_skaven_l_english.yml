Survivors speak of rats in the sewers, whispering with glee before the explosion. Some claim they saw hooded figures vanish into the shadows, their work complete.\n\nRebuilding will be arduous, but an even greater threat looms—stationing troops in the ruins may prove lethal, as the lingering corruption spreads sickness and madness. This was not just an attack; it was a warning. The Skaven are real, and they are watching.\n\nBut which rat is responsible?"

Or should we wait, hoping for an even bigger-better deposit to reveal itself nearby? Or maybe-maybe... leave it alone entirely? But who would do such a thing, yes-yes?"

Or perhaps... let them do whatever they want and watch what happens? Choose wisely, great ruler!"
