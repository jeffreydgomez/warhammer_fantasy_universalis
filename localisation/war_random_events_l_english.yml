jam_rnd.1.t:0 "Ritual Gone Wrong"
jam_rnd.1.d:0 "A pall of ash and dread now hangs over [This.GetName]. Trees are blackened husks, the skies churn with unnatural clouds, and even the winds whisper things best left unspoken. The ritual was meant to bring power, but something ancient stirred in protest.\n\nWhatever force was invoked did not stay contained. Villagers speak of shadows that move of their own accord, of beasts warped beyond sanity. The land itself recoils—we must decide how to respond."
jam_rnd.1.a:0 "Ignore it."
jam_rnd.1.b:0 "Send immediate aid."
jam_rnd.1.c:0 "The ritual went exactly as planned."

jam_rnd.2.t:0 "Reform Has Side Effects"
jam_rnd.2.d:0 "One of your recent reforms, intended to tighten governance, has birthed an unexpected loophole. The lower guilds exploit it shamelessly, while your advisors quietly suggest that the damage is—at least for now—acceptable.\n\nIt may be prudent to let the system breathe, lest you appear indecisive or tyrannical. But the longer it persists, the more entrenched the abuse may become."
jam_rnd.2.a:0 "Ban the reform."
jam_rnd.2.b:0 "Let it slide."

jam_rnd.3.t:0 "Mass Food Poisoning"
jam_rnd.3.d:0 "Rot and sickness have taken root in our granaries. Entire harvests have spoiled overnight, and rumors abound that a cult or saboteur is behind the blight.\n\nPanic stirs the hearts of the people. Some whisper it is Nurgle’s touch; others demand answers—and bread."
jam_rnd.3.a:0 "Hoard for the rich."
jam_rnd.3.b:0 "Intervene."
jam_rnd.3.c:0 "Nurgle would be pleased."

jam_rnd.4.t:0 "Intelligence Syphoned"
jam_rnd.4.d:0 "A costly blunder. Our agents were careless, and now classified plans have been compromised. A rival power—or worse, the servants of the Dark Gods—may already be exploiting this breach.\n\nWe must act swiftly to repair the damage, or risk becoming pawns in someone else's game."
jam_rnd.4.a:0 "It’s nothing."
jam_rnd.4.b:0 "Come up with a new plan, quickly!"
jam_rnd.4.c:0 "Yet another scheme..."

jam_rnd.5.t:0 "A Greedy Hag"
jam_rnd.5.d:0 "A hunched crone appeared in your throne room, robes stitched from skin and reeking of old sorcery. She offers a potion said to bestow cosmic insight—for a price steep in both coin and consequence.\n\nShe speaks of power beyond mortal reckoning, of voices that whisper truths from the void. Your advisors warn caution. Is it madness, or the path to greatness?"
jam_rnd.5.a:0 "Yes, please."
jam_rnd.5.b:0 "I don’t need such nonsense."

jam_rnd.51.t:0 "A Spiteful Death"
jam_rnd.51.d:0 "The hag's potion burned like venom through your veins. Your flesh withered, your mind cracked, and still you reached for eternity—and failed. Whatever you became in those last moments, it was not human.\n\nSome laugh. Others whisper you were cursed from the start. Either way, the crown is vacant again."
jam_rnd.51.a:0 "They were a fool to begin with."
jam_rnd.51.b:0 "Wait! I'll pay the hag double!"

jam_rnd.6.t:0 "Dragon Sighted"
jam_rnd.6.d:0 "Frightened peasants report seeing a great winged beast soaring over the hills—its scales like molten metal, its roar shaking the skies. Most dismiss the tale as superstition.\n\nBut charred trees and scorched livestock suggest otherwise. Should we act before it strikes again?"
jam_rnd.6.a:0 "It’s probably fake."
jam_rnd.6.b:0 "Pay someone to take care of it."
jam_rnd.6.c:0 "Send the army."

jam_rnd.7.t:0 "Local Tempest Wreaks Havoc"
jam_rnd.7.d:0 "The Winds of Magic have twisted into a howling maelstrom above [This.GetName]. Fire rains from the heavens, and entire hamlets are consumed in arcane fury.\n\nSurvivors cry for aid, their skin scorched and eyes glowing faintly green. Our people look to us for protection—or vengeance."
jam_rnd.7.a:0 "There’s nothing we can do."
jam_rnd.7.b:0 "Send aid."
jam_rnd.7.c:0 "Demand the mages redirect the storm."

jam_rnd.8.t:0 "Unregistered Caravan"
jam_rnd.8.d:0 "A mysterious caravan winds its way through our territory, bearing goods marked in foreign scripts. No sigils, no heralds, and no taxes paid.\n\nSome whisper they are smugglers, others fear something darker—daemonic relics, warp-tainted spices, or worse. Profit or peril awaits."
jam_rnd.8.a:0 "Raid it."
jam_rnd.8.b:0 "Escort them."
jam_rnd.8.c:0 "Arrange some agreements."

jam_rnd.9.t:0 "Orc Beat-Up Party"
jam_rnd.9.d:0 "A gang of green-skinned brutes, drunk on violence and fungus brew, rampages across the countryside. They smash, brawl, and leave only blood and laughter behind.\n\nMilitias are overwhelmed, and the people cry out for order—or for someone even stronger to lead the charge."
jam_rnd.9.a:0 "Send forces to deal with it."
jam_rnd.9.b:0 "Pay them to go elsewhere."
jam_rnd.9.c:0 "Join our boyz!"

jam_rnd.10.t:0 "Whole Village Enslaved"
jam_rnd.10.d:0 "A nightmare unfolded under cover of night. A village razed, its people vanished without trace, the only sign of struggle being desperate claw-marks on broken doors.\n\nIt reeks of Dark Elf raiders or Chaos reavers. Do we speak the truth, or bury it beneath silence and quick rebuilding?"
jam_rnd.10.a:0 "Dear god..."
jam_rnd.10.b:0 "Hide this from the public and quickly resettle."
jam_rnd.10.c:0 "Merely relocating our assets."

jam_rnd.11.t:0 "Steel-Eating Vermin"
jam_rnd.11.d:0 "Our supply depots have been overrun with vermin—but not ordinary rats. These foul things chew through steel and iron as if it were grain.\n\nSome suspect Skaven handiwork, others curse ancient hexes. Either way, our armories grow dangerously bare."
jam_rnd.11.a:0 "Do the best you can with the remaining weapons."
jam_rnd.11.b:0 "Redirect production."

jam_rnd.12.t:0 "Mage Corrupts Market"
jam_rnd.12.d:0 "A rogue spellcaster has disrupted trade by transmuting coinage and warping entire shipments. Rotten silk, lead masquerading as gold—chaos spreads through the Guilds like a plague.\n\nThe merchants demand retribution, the mages offer only silence. Will we side with power or commerce?"
jam_rnd.12.a:0 "Not my problem."
jam_rnd.12.b:0 "Demand the mages handle this."
jam_rnd.12.c:0 "Settle this professionally."

jam_rnd.13.t:0 "Warpstone Comet Crashlands"
jam_rnd.13.d:0 "The sky split open in a flash of unnatural green, and a thunderous crash followed. At the impact site lies a jagged shard of Warpstone, pulsing with insane energy.\n\nThose who approach too closely are driven mad or blessed with visions—depending on who you ask. Scholars and cultists alike are flocking toward the site."
jam_rnd.13.a:0 "What is this glowing rock??"
jam_rnd.13.b:0 "Get it out of here!?"

jam_rnd.14.t:0 "Recruits Go Mad"
jam_rnd.14.d:0 "Fresh recruits, once eager and loyal, now scream in tongues and claw at their own skin. Whatever madness grips them spreads like fire through the camp.\n\nSome call for immediate purging; others argue they can still serve. But one thing is certain—they are no longer men."
jam_rnd.14.a:0 "Execute them."
jam_rnd.14.b:0 "We need all the men we can get."
jam_rnd.14.c:0 "Cleanse them."
