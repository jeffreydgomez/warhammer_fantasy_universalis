vampire_events.4.title:0 "The Undead Rest Uneasily"  
vampire_events.4.desc:0 "The winds of magic shift uneasily, disrupting the necromantic spells binding your undead legions together. Soldiers crumble to dust, weapons fall from skeletal hands, and the air is heavy with foreboding. Your commanders report increasing difficulty in maintaining control over the armies as their cohesion begins to falter.\n\nThe Liche Priests recommend reinforcing the spells holding your minions together, but doing so will require expending valuable magical power. Alternatively, you could let the weak perish, confident that new forces can always be raised from the countless dead beneath the earth."  
vampire_events.4.a:0 "Reinforce the spells."  
vampire_events.4.b:0 "Let them rot. We can always raise more."  

vampire_events.5.title:0 "Restless Ghosts Wander the Countryside"

Whether born of ancient curses or unresolved grudges, these spirits sow chaos wherever they roam, disrupting both the living and the dead.\n\nYou could attempt to soothe these restless spirits with an elaborate ritual, or let them wander freely, their presence serving as a warning to any who might oppose your rule. Alternatively, a necromancer could be bind them into your service, bolstering your forces with spectral might."

The burial chamber is a testament to his power, filled with treasures and bound spirits. However, disturbing this tomb may provoke the wrath of the long-dead monarch and his spectral guardians.\n\nThe priests suggest sealing the tomb, ensuring that its dangerous contents remain undisturbed. Alternatively, the riches within could be looted, though doing so may invoke a terrible curse. For those with necromantic powers, there remains the option of raising the ancient king himself to serve your will."

Though his methods are unorthodox, the results are undeniable—his experiments have revealed new possibilities in the manipulation of life and death.\n\nYou could bring him into your court and allow his ideas to flourish, though doing so might disrupt the stability of your administration. Alternatively, you could destroy him now, consuming his power and ensuring no rival grows strong enough to challenge your authority."  
vampire_events.8.a:0 "Bring him to court and test out his ideas."  
vampire_events.8.b:0 "Consume his soul. He's too dangerous."  

vampire_events.9.title:0 "Shall We Summon Storms of Vampiric Energy?"  
vampire_events.9.desc:0 "In the heat of war, your necromancers propose a bold plan: to unleash a storm of dark magic upon the battlefield, annihilating your enemies with vampiric energy. Such a ritual could turn the tide of any conflict, but its cost would be significant, draining both your resources and the vitality of your forces.\n\nThe decision lies in your hands. Will you unleash this destructive power, or restrain your ambitions to avoid depleting your strength?"
