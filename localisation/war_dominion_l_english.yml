Once more, the ancient rite shall be enacted — a conclave of the princes to choose who shall bear the Crown of Fire and sit upon the Phoenix Throne.\n\nEnvoys ride under moonlight, warriors parade through the streets, and mages divine omens in the stars. The Sacred Flame of Asuryan flickers higher, sensing the coming decision. Soon, the votes will be cast.\n\nPrepare well — prestige, stability, martial might, ruler's abilities, and your standing among the electors shall decide your fate. The Flame is impartial... but it remembers."

Though challengers stirred and rival banners were unfurled, none could claim the loyalty we command nor the glory we have earned.\n\nWe received [ROOT.dominion_vote.GetValue] votes: [ROOT.prestige_votes.GetValue] from our prestige, [ROOT.stability_votes.GetValue] from our stability, [ROOT.army_votes.GetValue] from our army size, [ROOT.total_opinion_votes.GetValue] from the opinion of other voters, and [ROOT.ruler_stats_votes.GetValue] from the wisdom and strength of our sovereign.\n\nThe Phoenix Throne remains ours.

And so too may be our destiny, if we endure, grow stronger, and bide our time.\n\n[vote_winner.GetName] has ascended the Throne with [vote_winner.dominion_vote.GetValue] votes: [vote_winner.prestige_votes.GetValue] from their false prestige, [vote_winner.stability_votes.GetValue] from their temporary stability, [vote_winner.army_votes.GetValue] from their weak legions, [vote_winner.total_opinion_votes.GetValue] from their temporary friendships, and [vote_winner.ruler_stats_votes.GetValue] from their sovereign’s meager abilities.\n\nWe received [ROOT.dominion_vote.GetValue] votes: [ROOT.prestige_votes.GetValue] from our prestige, [ROOT.stability_votes.GetValue] from our stability, [ROOT.army_votes.GetValue] from our army size, [ROOT.total_opinion_votes.GetValue] from the opinion of other voters, and [ROOT.ruler_stats_votes.GetValue] from the wisdom and strength of our sovereign.\n\nLet us not despair.
