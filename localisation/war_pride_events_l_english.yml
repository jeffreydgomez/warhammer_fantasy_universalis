pride_events.1.desc:0 "The winds howl across the jagged cliffs of Albion, a land cloaked in mists and mystery. For centuries, our druids have safeguarded the sacred secrets of the Old Ones, interpreting omens in the stones and calling upon the power of the storm to protect this island. Ours is a people forged by the unforgiving rains and the spirits of ancient power, surviving not through might of armies but through a deep connection to the land and the forgotten lore of a time before the Chaos Gods' dominion.\n\nIn the days of myth, Albion was said to be the beating heart of the Old Ones' great plan, a nexus of ley lines that once pulsed with unparalleled magical energy. Yet those golden days were shattered during the cataclysm that unleashed Chaos upon the world, leaving our island a shrouded relic of its former glory. The men and women of Albion have lived on in defiance of the gods' abandonment, turning to the druids, the Stone Circles, and the mighty giants that call our land home.\n\nThough the world views us as primitive, we know the truth: we are the guardians of a sacred trust. From the days of Wulfrik the Wanderer to the invasions of Norse marauders, Albion has endured as a bastion of ancient power. But in a time where steel and fire rule the world, we must ask ourselves: what does it truly mean to be Albionese? Are we the keepers of a forgotten heritage, or something more?"

pride_events.2.desc:0 "Deep within the lush and deadly jungles of Lustria, the Amazons have carved out a fierce and proud existence. Hidden from the eyes of lesser peoples, our warriors move with unmatched grace and power, harnessing the raw strength of the jungle and the secrets of the stars. Since the days of myth, when the Old Ones first set foot upon this world, our foremothers claimed their divine destiny, inheriting not only survival but the strength to command a world hostile to the weak.\n\nLegends tell of our ancestors, chosen by the Old Ones themselves, armed with the gifts of divine power and guided by the mysterious tablets of ancient lore. From our fortified enclaves, we guard these ancient relics and maintain our sacred bond with the heavens. While others see only chaos in the wilderness of Lustria, we see the truth: the jungle is a living entity, and we are its chosen daughters, fierce and unyielding. We thrive where others perish, for we understand the balance of nature's fury and blessing.\n\nOur history is written in the blood of those who would dare invade our lands. From the Norse raiders who defiled our temples to the greedy men of the Empire who sought to plunder our treasures, all who challenge the Amazons are reminded of why we are feared. We fight with the strength of beasts, the cunning of hunters, and the blessings of the Old Ones themselves. But with the jungle as our home and the stars as our guide, we must ask: what does it truly mean to be an Amazon? Are we merely guardians of this sacred land, or something more?"

pride_events.3.desc:0 "Beneath the blazing sun and amidst the endless dunes, Araby thrives as a land of splendor, trade, and devotion. For centuries, our great sultans have ruled from the shining cities of golden domes, commanding both the vast desert and the vibrant ports that connect the Old World to the Southlands and beyond. From the timeless majesty of Al-haikk to the sacred sands of Lashiek, our culture is a blend of wisdom, faith, and prosperity. Yet, even here, where the stars shine brighter and the winds carry the whispers of the djinn, challenges have always tested our mettle.\n\nOur ancestors rose against invaders like the Bretonnians during the Crusades, proving that even the greatest knights of the Old World could not match the cunning and resilience of Araby’s defenders. Through wit, guile, and the might of our Janissaries, we turned back their righteous zeal and preserved our way of life. We are a people of both war and art, with swords sharp enough to repel invaders and minds creative enough to build marvels that inspire awe across the world.\n\nYet, we are more than warriors and merchants—we are a people guided by faith. The djinn of the desert and the eternal wisdom of our scholars remind us that the sands are more than mere grit. They are sacred, connecting us to the past and binding us to our destiny. But in this time of great change and rising powers, we must ask ourselves: what does it mean to be Arabyan? Are we destined only to survive, or to rise above all others?"

pride_events.4.desc:0 "In the shadowed depths of Athel Loren, the Asrai walk a path known only to those who share the bond of the forest. We are not merely a people—we are an extension of the great living woods, protectors and children of the ancient spirits that dwell within. Our lives are intertwined with the will of the forest and the balance it seeks to maintain. For centuries, we have stood against the tide of destruction, repelling the beasts and invaders that dare to trespass upon these sacred glades.\n\nThe Wild Hunt, led by the eternal Orion, is more than a legend—it is the lifeblood of our struggle against the darkness that seeks to engulf Athel Loren. From the shadow wars fought against the vile Beastmen to our triumphs against the lumbering greenskin hordes, we have proven time and time again that we are more than warriors—we are the keepers of a delicate harmony. Yet, with each season, the dangers grow greater, and the forest demands more of its guardians.\n\nAs the winds of magic shift and the outside world continues to encroach upon our borders, we must ask ourselves: what does it mean to be Asrai? Are we bound only to defend the forest, or can we shape our destiny beyond the trees?"

pride_events.5.desc:0 "The spires of Ulthuan rise above the glimmering seas, a testament to the majesty and wisdom of the Asur. Long ago, our people were chosen by the Old Ones to be the stewards of the world, wielding magic and might to protect the mortal realms from the forces of Chaos. Yet, even with our unmatched splendor, the history of the Asur is one of bitter struggle. The Sundering, that great schism which tore our people apart, still echoes in the hearts of all who call Ulthuan home.\n\nFor millennia, we have defended the Vortex, the great spell that holds back the tides of Chaos. Our victories against the Druchii, our cursed kin, and the beastly invaders who have sought to despoil our lands have proven the strength and resilience of the Asur. The Phoenix King and the Everqueen guide us, as they have since time immemorial, ensuring that our ancient traditions endure.\n\nBut even the Asur must change. The world is shifting, and the tides of power ebb and flow. What does it mean to be Asur in such a time? Are we the unchanging guardians of tradition, or is there something more to be found in the winds of magic and the fires of war?"

pride_events.6.desc:0 "The herds roam the cursed forests and desolate plains, driven by hatred for the weakling races of man and elf. We are the children of Chaos, the purest expression of the gods' will, untainted by the lies of civilization. Where we tread, the land weeps and burns, for we are the destroyers of order and the harbingers of the gods' wrath. From the Great Bray-Shamans to the mighty Doombulls, we are united in our purpose to drown the world in anarchy and blood.\n\nOur history is a cycle of slaughter and vengeance. The forests remember the blood spilled in our eternal war with the Asrai, and the ruins of mankind’s cities are testament to our fury. The Herdstones stand as unbreakable symbols of our power, gathering the winds of magic and focusing them into destructive might. Every moonlit gathering of the herds strengthens our resolve, and every razed village brings us closer to our destiny.\n\nBut we are more than beasts—we are Chaos incarnate. The question remains: what does it mean to be Beastmen? Are we simply the destroyers of the old order, or something far greater?"

pride_events.7.desc:0 "Bretonnia is a land of chivalry and devotion, where the Lady of the Lake watches over her chosen knights. From the grand castles of Couronne to the fertile fields of Aquitaine, we are a people united by honor, faith, and duty. The Code of Chivalry guides our every action, and the knights who bear its mantle are the shining example of all that is noble in this world. Yet, Bretonnia’s history is one of struggle, of rising above the trials that have tested our mettle time and time again.\n\nWhen the orc hordes descended from the mountains, it was the Grail Knights who answered the call, driving the greenskins back into the darkness. When the undead legions of Mousillon threatened our borders, it was the strength of our faith and the might of our lances that stood firm. From the earliest days of Gilles le Breton to the reign of our current king, we have proven that honor and valor are mightier than any dark sorcery or brute force.\n\nYet, the world grows darker, and even the light of Bretonnia may falter. What does it truly mean to be Bretonnian? Are we merely relics of a fading past, or the defenders of a brighter future?"

Our empire is as vast as the skies, our walls as enduring as the mountains, and our culture as ancient as the stars. From the sprawling trade cities of Wei-Jin to the isolated mountain monasteries, Cathay has long been a land of harmony, order, and strength.\n\nWe are the guardians of the Great Bastion, the wall that shields the world from the howling tides of Chaos that threaten to engulf us all. The tales of our ancestors speak of immortal dragons who descended from the heavens, taking mortal form to lead and protect the empire. Their wisdom shapes us still, guiding the decisions of emperors and peasants alike. With such a legacy, it is little wonder that Cathay remains unbroken in a world of strife.\n\nBut the world beyond our borders shifts. From the Sea of Storms to the Silk Road, new opportunities and challenges arise. What does it mean to be Cathayan in an age of upheaval? Are we simply stewards of an ancient legacy, or will Cathay’s destiny shine brighter than ever?"

pride_events.9.desc:0 "Deep beneath the ash-choked skies of the Dark Lands, the forges of the Chaos Dwarfs burn hotter than any other. We are the Dawi-Zharr, the twisted cousins of the mountain folk, chosen by Hashut, the Father of Darkness. Our forges produce machines of destruction that none can rival, and our minds twist the winds of magic into new forms of cruelty. Though we are few, our strength lies in the toil of countless slaves and the unyielding fire of our ambition.\n\nOur story is one of defiance and transformation. When the ancestors of the Dawi turned away from us, we turned to Hashut, and through his blessings, we became greater than they could ever imagine. The great cities of Zharr-Naggrund and Uzkulak are monuments to our might, towering above the broken lands of the East. Through conquest and industry, we bring order to the chaos of the world, forging a legacy in blood and fire.\n\nYet, even as our forges burn, we must wonder: what does it mean to be a Chaos Dwarf? Are we the ultimate expression of dwarven ingenuity, or something entirely new—a people forged in the fires of ambition?"

While others see us as desperate or mad, we know the truth: the Dark Lands breed resilience, and from the ashes of despair, greatness can rise.\n\nOur cities cling to the lifelines of trade that snake through this hostile terrain. Whether dealing with the ruthless Chaos Dwarfs, the barbaric greenskins, or the opportunistic traders from the west, we have learned to adapt and survive. The history of the Dark Lands is written in blood, from the fall of the Silver Pinnacle to the destruction wrought by the ever-encroaching hordes of Chaos.\n\nYet survival is not enough. What does it mean to be a Darklander in a world that looks down upon us? Are we destined only to endure, or can we rise above and forge a destiny that reshapes the perception of our people?"

We are not bound by the illusions of morality or mercy—ours is a path of power, and only the strongest shall rise.\n\nFrom the Corsairs who raid the coasts of the Old World to the sorceresses of Ghrond who twist the winds of magic, the Druchii have proven that strength comes from the willingness to do whatever is necessary. Our history is one of triumph over weakness, from the conquest of Har Ganeth to the unrelenting assaults on Ulthuan. Yet, even as we spill the blood of our enemies, the shadow of the Phoenix King mocks us still.\n\nBut we are more than exiles. What does it truly mean to be Druchii?
