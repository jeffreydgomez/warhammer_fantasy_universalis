From crumbling tombs to mass graves, the long-slumbering legions of undeath march once more. At their center stands Nagash—the Great Necromancer, the Undying King—reborn in darkness, his power eclipsing all who came before him.\n\nThe winds of magic scream as death floods the world. Where his shadow falls, the living wither, their souls torn from their bodies to swell his ever-growing legions. Cities crumble, their streets choked with the restless dead. His will is absolute, his hunger limitless—Nagash does not seek conquest; he seeks dominion over all things, living and dead alike.\n\nA terrible choice now stands before us. We may attempt to bind Nagash to our service through dark rituals, bending his power to our will. But such an act is fraught with peril, for he is death incarnate, and no chains may hold him forever. Or we may surrender, allowing him to take the throne and reshape our nation in his own dread image. Either way, the world will never be the same."

tomb_king.101.desc:0 "The great experiment of undeath has collapsed in ruin. The halls of our capital lie in smoldering ruin, and the dark majesty of Nagash has been undone. His immortal form, once thought impervious to time and steel, has been shattered by the relentless assault of our enemies. The Great Necromancer is no more—his essence scattered, his dominion over death severed.\n\nFor a moment, the world seems to exhale. The oppressive weight of his presence fades, and the dead no longer rise at his command. His fell empire fractures, its legions of skeletal warriors collapsing into dust, unbound from his terrible will. Where once his shadow stretched across the land, only silence remains.\n\nBut true death has eluded Nagash before. Though his physical form is destroyed, whispers persist that he is not gone, merely waiting. One day, when the stars align and the world has forgotten its fear, he may yet rise again to claim what was denied to him."
