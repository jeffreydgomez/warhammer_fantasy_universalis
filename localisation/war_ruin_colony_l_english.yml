 ruins_events.1.title:0 "A Curious Discovery"
ruins_events.1.desc:0 "The ruins have yielded many strange things, but nothing as alluring as the shimmering green stones uncovered beneath the collapsed streets. The colonists whisper about their power—how they pulse with an unnatural glow, how they hum when touched. Some have already gathered small fragments, tucking them away in pockets and satchels, eager to bring them home as souvenirs.\n\nYet the deeper the miners dig, the more they uncover signs of past calamity—burned-out tunnels, claw marks along the walls, and bones twisted into unnatural shapes. The air grows thick with an acrid scent, and the wind carries chittering echoes from below. Still, the promise of wealth and power is intoxicating. The colonists plead: should they take these stones back home?"

ruins_events.1.a:0 "What harm could a few stones do?"
ruins_events.1.b:0 "No! Leave them be!"

ruins_events.2.title:0 "Dark Whispers in the Colony"
ruins_events.2.desc:0 "At first, it was just strange dreams—visions of shifting shapes and voices calling from beyond the veil. But soon, letters began arriving from the colony, filled with unsettling proclamations. Some colonists claim they have glimpsed truth beyond mortal comprehension, scrawling cryptic symbols on their homes, their words fevered and rapturous. The local priests warn that something sinister has taken root.\n\nA few settlers have begun preaching openly, urging others to listen to the 'gifts' of the city. They speak of change, of rebirth, of the embrace of something greater. Do we act swiftly to purge this corruption, or allow them to continue—so long as they keep working?"

ruins_events.2.a:0 "Burn the heretics!"
ruins_events.2.b:0 "As long as they build, they may write."

ruins_events.3.title:0 "The Chittering Horde"
ruins_events.3.desc:0 "The colony woke to screams in the night. From the tunnels beneath the ruins, a swarm of chittering creatures spilled forth—twisted, hunched things with beady red eyes and rusted weapons. They moved like a tide, striking from the shadows, dragging the unwary into the depths. By dawn, the streets were slick with blood, and the air reeked of musk and decay.\n\nSurvivors whisper that the attack was not random. The creatures seemed to know where to strike, where to cut supply lines and ambush patrols. Were they watching us all along? Did we awaken something we should have left buried? One thing is certain—the colony must be defended, or it will be lost."

ruins_events.3.a:0 "To arms! Drive them back!"

ruins_events.4.title:0 "A Rift in Reality"
ruins_events.4.desc:0 "A storm unlike any other hangs over the ruins, a swirling vortex of darkness and shrieking winds. The settlers have seen figures within—things with too many eyes, with limbs that shift and warp as they move. At night, whispers echo through the ruins, and shadows stretch unnaturally in the torchlight. Something is stirring in the depths of this place, and it has noticed us.\n\nThen, the attack begins. Screaming figures burst from the ruins, clad in jagged armor, their eyes burning with unnatural hunger. Some colonists fall to their blades, others flee—only to be caught by the horrors lurking in the mist. The colony must stand, or it will be consumed."

ruins_events.4.a:0 "Hold the line!"

ruins_events.5.title:0 "Vanished Without a Trace"
ruins_events.5.desc:0 "At first, it was only one or two settlers who failed to return from their work. Then, an entire scouting party disappeared without a sound. Their tools lay abandoned, meals left half-eaten, their homes empty as if they had never been there at all. The only clue is a single trail leading deeper into the ruins, where the air is thick with silence and the buildings seem to watch with hollow eyes.\n\nSome urge caution, saying that to send another group is to invite the same fate. Others insist that answers must be found. If we do not act, who knows how many more will vanish in the days to come?"

ruins_events.5.a:0 "We cannot risk more lives."
ruins_events.5.b:0 "Send a search party. We must know."
ruins_events.5.c:0 "Arm the search party! We will not lose more."

ruins_events.6.title:0 "The Sealed Vault"
ruins_events.6.desc:0 "Beneath the ruined city, workers uncovered a massive vault—its doors sealed with runes long faded, its stone frame warped and cracked as if strained from within. The metal is strangely cold to the touch, and those who linger too close claim to hear whispers in languages they do not understand. Whatever is inside has been locked away for a reason, and the weight of history urges caution.\n\nYet others speak of the knowledge, the wealth, the power that may lie beyond those doors. What was hidden here in ages past? Should we dare to break the seals, or let it remain forgotten, as the ancients intended?"

ruins_events.6.a:0 "Seal it once more. Some things are best left buried."
ruins_events.6.b:0 "Open it. Knowledge must not be feared."

ruins_events.7.title:0 "Dreams of a New Home"
ruins_events.7.desc:0 "The ruins, for all their dangers, have captivated the minds of some within our capital. Young dreamers speak of reclaiming what was lost, of building something new upon the bones of the old world. They say the colony needs strong hands and fresh minds, and they are eager to go. Some even claim to hear the ruins calling to them in their sleep.\n\nShould we allow these settlers to leave their homes and venture into the unknown? Perhaps their enthusiasm will bring new life to the colony—or perhaps they will simply feed whatever hungers in the dark."

ruins_events.7.a:0 "Let them go. A new beginning awaits."
ruins_events.7.b:0 "Send even more! The ruins must be reclaimed."
ruins_events.7.c:0 "No. They are safer here."

colonize_mordheim_desc:0 "Once, Mordheim was a thriving city, a jewel of the Empire. Now, it stands as a cursed ruin, its streets choked with the dead and its air thick with the taint of Chaos. Yet, within its shattered remains lies opportunity—wealth to reclaim, land to settle, and a legacy to restore. The question remains: can we truly tame this forsaken place, or will it consume those who dare to return?\n\nBe warned! Attempting to colonize this cursed city will be expensive and dangerous, particularly in the Age of Corruption."
