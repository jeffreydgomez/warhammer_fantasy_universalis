ruler_skill_events.1.t:0 "The Mysterious Tutor"
ruler_skill_events.1.d:0 "A strange figure has appeared at my court, offering to teach me what I lack. Their knowledge is vast—almost otherworldly—and their methods are as relentless as they are effective. They demand much of me, and even more of the state.  It seems the court is uneasy about them, muttering about their peculiar nature and unclear intentions. Yet, I must admit, I am tempted.\n\nShould I accept their teachings, even if it risks draining my nation and inviting... complications? Or should I send them away and avoid meddling with such a questionable presence?"

I find myself spending sleepless nights working tirelessly, pushing my limits and ignoring the toll it takes on my mind and body.\n\nMy court grows worried, and perhaps they are right to be.

ruler_skill_events.3.d:0 "As I grow older, I find myself questioning the things that once mattered most to me. The thrill of war, the art of negotiation, the intricacies of governance—what once inspired me now seems hollow. Perhaps it is time to explore new paths and focus on different priorities.\n\nI can feel the court watching, eager to see what I will choose. Will these changes make me a better ruler, or will they simply leave the realm adrift? I must decide."

ruler_skill_events.4.d:0 "I have decided to set myself on a path of self-improvement. Whether it is mastering the art of administration, becoming a diplomat worthy of the greatest courts, or refining my skills in war, I know that I can grow stronger. Of course, such growth comes with sacrifice, and my ambitions may strain the resources of the state.\n\nStill, if I am to lead, should I not strive to be the best version of myself? Or am I fooling myself, chasing a dream that might harm my realm more than it helps?"

ruler_skill_events.5.d:0 "I can feel it—this pressure, this weight on my shoulders. It’s driving me mad! Every demand, every decision, every expectation from the court feels like a nail hammered into my skull. I need to let this out before it consumes me completely, but how? The court whispers of my instability, but they do not understand what it’s like to bear this burden.\n\nPerhaps I should lash out, or indulge my whims, or do something—anything—to release this tension.

It is so revolutionary, so forward-thinking, that I have decided to adjust my policies accordingly.\n\nMy advisors, however, are less enthusiastic. They insist that this idea is not just bad, but outright disastrous. But what do they know? They are merely paid professionals, experts in their fields! Not natural rulers, like me!"

ruler_skill_events.7.t:0 "Hubris"
ruler_skill_events.7.d:0 "The realm marvels my brilliance of Truly, few rulers throughout history have matched such commanding ability. Yet with greatness comes the burden of perception.
