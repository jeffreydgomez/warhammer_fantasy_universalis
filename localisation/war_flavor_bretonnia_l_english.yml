 flavor_bretonnia.1.d: "In the wake of the passing of our beloved Royarch, the time has come for the Grail Council of Bastonne to convene once more. Assembled within the sacred halls of the Grail Cathedral, as many Grail Knights as can attend gather to fulfill their solemn duty in selecting the next ruler of Bretonnia. \n\n Amidst the hallowed whispers of ancient rites and the solemn prayers to the Lady of the Lake, the Grail Knights deliberate with unwavering resolve. Each voice carries the weight of tradition and honor as they seek to discern the candidate most worthy of wielding the mantle of kingship. \n\n Once a unanimous decision is reached, the chosen successor is presented to the Fay Enchantress, the holy representative of the Lady of the Lake. With her divine blessing, the election is solemnized, and the chosen Grail Knight is crowned as the new Royarch, tasked with guiding our noble realm with wisdom and valor for life.\n\nWho do the Grail knights of our fair realm determine is most worthy?\n\nNations will vote based on relations, stability, military and economic power, prestige, and ruler skill.

 flavor_bretonnia.900.t: "[Root.grail_quest_heir_name.GetName] Embarks on the Grail Quest"
 flavor_bretonnia.900.d: "Amidst whispers of anticipation and reverence, [Root.grail_quest_heir_name.GetName] stands before you, eyes filled with determination and resolve. With a solemn voice, they declare their intention to embark on the Grail Quest, a sacred pilgrimage in search of the legendary Grail that has long been the symbol of Bretonnian honor and chivalry.\n\nAs a ruler of Bretonnia, you are faced with a momentous decision. Will you grant [Root.grail_quest_heir_name.GetName] your blessing and support in their noble quest, knowing that they may face dangers and trials beyond imagination? Or will you counsel caution, urging them to remain by your side and fulfill their duties to the realm?\n\nChoose wisely, for the fate of your heir and the future of Bretonnia hang in the balance. Should you grant your blessing, your heir will set forth on a journey of epic proportions, seeking to prove themselves worthy of the Grail and the divine favor of the Lady of the Lake. But be warned - the road ahead is fraught with peril, and not all who embark on the Grail Quest return unchanged.\n\nConsider your decision carefully, for the choices you make now will shape the destiny of [Root.grail_quest_heir_name.GetName] and the kingdom of Bretonnia for generations to come. Will they emerge victorious, bathed in the light of the Lady's grace? Or will they be lost to the mists of legend, their fate forever intertwined with the mysteries of the Grail?"
 flavor_bretonnia.900.a: "May the Lady guide and protect you on your noble quest!"

flavor_bretonnia.901.t:0 "A Fearsome Beast"
flavor_bretonnia.901.d:0 "In the shadowed depths of an ancient forest, the air grows thick with tension, the silence broken only by the rustle of leaves and the snapping of twigs beneath the hooves of the heir’s steed. Suddenly, a terrible roar rends the air, and a monstrous beast emerges from the gloom. Its eyes blaze with unnatural malice, and its jagged claws glint in the dim, filtered sunlight. The air feels heavy, as though the Lady herself is watching, testing the courage and resolve of her chosen knight. For any Bretonnian, such a foe is more than just a creature—it is a trial sent by fate, a test of valor and honor.\n\nTo face this beast in single combat would bring glory beyond measure and serve as a sign of the heir’s worthiness for the grail. Yet, the risk is dire: many knights who have faced such monsters have been remembered only as names on weathered tombstones. Calling upon loyal retainers to fight the creature instead might preserve the heir’s life, but it will tarnish his honor in the eyes of men and gods. To flee, though practical, is unthinkable for a knight of Bretonnia. Each decision carries the weight of destiny, for the quest is as much a battle of the spirit as of the sword."
flavor_bretonnia.901.a:0 "Fight the beast with honor!"
flavor_bretonnia.901.b:0 "Command your men to engage!"
flavor_bretonnia.901.c:0 "Retreat and preserve your life."

flavor_bretonnia.902.t:0 "A Beggar's Plea"
flavor_bretonnia.902.d:0 "On the open road, the heir encounters a pitiful figure kneeling by the roadside, hands trembling and outstretched. The beggar’s clothes are in tatters, barely covering his frail, shivering frame. His voice is weak as he pleads for alms, his words choking on despair as he tells of a family lost to famine and plague. The heir, a noble of great renown, is reminded that a knight’s duty extends not only to vanquishing foes but also to aiding the helpless. The Lady watches over the pure of heart, and this moment feels like her test of the heir’s compassion.\n\nTo offer a generous gift would surely prove his virtue, though the quest’s funds grow thin and the road ahead remains long. A small token might ease the beggar’s suffering while conserving resources, but such half-measures lack the grandeur expected of a questing knight. And yet, to ride on without helping at all would bring shame and stain the heir’s honor. As the heir contemplates his decision, he is struck by the beggar’s tearful eyes—a reminder that true knighthood is not measured by strength alone but by mercy as well."
flavor_bretonnia.902.a:0 "Offer a generous gift."
flavor_bretonnia.902.b:0 "Give a small token."
flavor_bretonnia.902.c:0 "Ignore the beggar and ride on."

flavor_bretonnia.903.t:0 "An Insult to the Kingdom"
flavor_bretonnia.903.d:0 "The heir steps into a bustling tavern, seeking a moment’s respite from the endless journey. Yet as he settles, his ears catch a vile insult carried on the drunken slur of a coarse voice. A swaggering rogue mocks the Lady of the Lake, sneering at Bretonnia’s knights and their sacred vows. The room falls silent, all eyes turning to the heir, who rises with a fury that threatens to spill over into violence. The insult cuts deeper than any blade; it is not just an affront to him but to the very ideals he swore to uphold.\n\nThis moment demands action, but each path carries its own risk. To challenge the scoundrel to a duel would prove the heir’s valor, though it risks his life for the sake of honor. A scornful dismissal—perhaps with a goblet of wine thrown in anger—could show his disdain without bloodshed, but it lacks the glory of a knight’s bold stand. To leave the insult unanswered is the safest choice but one that may forever tarnish his reputation. The heir must weigh the call of honor against the wisdom of caution, knowing that the entire tavern now watches his every move."
flavor_bretonnia.903.a:0 "Challenge the knave to a duel."
flavor_bretonnia.903.b:0 "Hurl your wine and leave."
flavor_bretonnia.903.c:0 "Walk away in quiet disdain."

flavor_bretonnia.904.t:0 "A Tournament in Town"
flavor_bretonnia.904.d:0 "The heir rides into a lively town, greeted by the sound of trumpets and the sight of brightly colored banners fluttering in the breeze. A grand tournament has been announced, and knights from across the land gather to test their mettle in jousts and melee combat. The lists are set, and the crowds cheer as each noble competitor takes the field. It is a spectacle of chivalry, a celebration of knightly valor that stirs the heir’s blood. Yet, the grail quest looms large in his thoughts, its importance outweighing even the glory of the tournament.\n\nTo enter the lists would risk injury and humiliation, but it could also bring fame and riches to support the journey ahead. Victories in the arena might bolster the heir’s claim to greatness, proving his worth as a future king. But to decline and press on with the quest is to show a different kind of strength—the resolve to place duty above personal glory. The choice is a difficult one, for both paths reflect the ideals of Bretonnia in their own way."
flavor_bretonnia.904.a:0 "Enter the lists and join the joust."
flavor_bretonnia.904.b:0 "Decline and continue the quest."

flavor_bretonnia.905.t:0 "A Purse Grown Light"
flavor_bretonnia.905.d:0 "The quest has stretched the heir’s resources to their limit. His once-full coffers now hold little more than dust, and his retainers grow restless with the lack of proper wages and supplies. The road has become harsher, the inns less welcoming, and the journey feels heavier with every passing day. The heir contemplates his next move, knowing that the realm’s aid might save his quest but also recognizing the shame of such a request.\n\nTo seek aid from the capital would ensure the journey’s continuation, but it might be seen as a sign of weakness. Returning home would mean abandoning the quest altogether—a failure that could haunt the heir for years to come. As he weighs his options, the heir recalls the tales of knights who pressed on despite adversity, driven by their faith in the Lady. The path forward is fraught with uncertainty, but the heir knows that true chivalry lies in perseverance."
flavor_bretonnia.905.a:0 "Request aid and press on."
flavor_bretonnia.905.b:0 "Return home to gather strength."

flavor_bretonnia.906.t:0 "A Fortune Foretold"
flavor_bretonnia.906.d:0 "In a quiet village nestled between rolling hills, the heir is approached by a strange figure cloaked in shadow. The woman claims to be a seer, gifted with the ability to see the threads of fate. Her voice is both soothing and unsettling as she offers to reveal the heir’s future—for a price. She warns, however, that the truth is not always kind, and that to gaze into the unknown is to risk one’s sanity.\n\nThe heir feels the weight of the offer, knowing that knowledge of the path ahead could grant him great advantage. Yet, the thought of what he might learn—a failure foretold, a death foretold—fills him with unease. To refuse the seer is to walk the harder path, guided only by faith and courage. But to accept is to gamble with forces beyond mortal comprehension. The choice hangs in the air like a sword over his head."
flavor_bretonnia.906.a:0 "Pay the price to learn your fate."
flavor_bretonnia.906.b:0 "Refuse and walk away."

flavor_bretonnia.907.t:0 "An Obsession?"
flavor_bretonnia.907.d:0 "The road stretches endlessly before the heir, and with each mile, the weight of the quest grows heavier. His companions whisper doubts among themselves, questioning whether this path was truly chosen by the Lady or if it is merely the folly of a young noble seeking glory. The heir feels their eyes upon him, their faith wavering as the journey drags on without clear progress. His own heart begins to waver, the dream of the grail seeming ever more distant.\n\nTo press forward is to prove his resilience, to show his companions that true knighthood lies in unyielding determination. Yet, the thought of returning home grows tempting—there, safety and comfort await, free from the dangers and uncertainties of the road. But to abandon the quest is to admit failure, to surrender the dream that has driven him this far. The heir knows that the choice he makes now will define not only his journey but his legacy as a knight."
flavor_bretonnia.907.a:0 "Ignore the naysayers and press forward"
flavor_bretonnia.907.b:0 "Return home and abandon the quest."


flavor_bretonnia.910.t:0 "A Journey's End?"
flavor_bretonnia.910.d:0 "The heir’s journey nears its end, the trials and tribulations weighing heavily upon him. Through battles fought, doubts conquered, and sacrifices made, the path to the grail now stands before him—or so it seems. What awaits is not yet clear: triumph, mediocrity, or failure.\n\nThe grail is a prize granted only to the most virtuous. Has the heir proven himself worthy, or will the Lady of the Lake deny his request? This moment defines the legacy of the quest and the future of the realm."
flavor_bretonnia.910.a:0 "Face the final test of your quest."

 flavor_bretonnia.911.t: "[Root.grail_quest_heir_name.GetName] Returns!"
 flavor_bretonnia.911.d: "With banners waving high and trumpets sounding, the realm of Bretonnia welcomes the triumphant return of [Root.grail_quest_heir_name.GetName], who emerges from the mists of legend as a true champion of the Lady's grace. Their successful completion of the sacred Grail Quest fills the hearts of all with hope and inspiration, as tales of their valor and virtue spread far and wide throughout the kingdom. Long live [Root.grail_quest_heir_name.GetName], the embodiment of Bretonnian chivalry and honor!\n\n While [Root.grail_quest_heir_name.GetName] drank from the Grail, some part of him yearns again for the life of adventure. The Lady has promised the Grail to the greatest knight of them all..."
 flavor_bretonnia.911.a: "[Root.grail_quest_heir_name.GetName] triumphant return fills our hearts with joy and our realm with hope!"
 flavor_bretonnia.911.b: "I must continue my quest!"

flavor_bretonnia.912.t:0 "The Grail is Found!"
flavor_bretonnia.912.d:0 "Through peril and sacrifice, the heir has achieved the impossible—he has found the grail. The Lady herself appears to grant him her blessing, her divine light sanctifying his quest. As he drinks from the grail, his mortal form is transformed, becoming a beacon of virtue for the realm.\n\nBretonnia rejoices, for such a champion arises only once in an age. The Lady’s blessing shall ensure the land prospers, its people forever inspired by this paragon of knighthood."
flavor_bretonnia.912.a:0 "Hail the knight who found the grail!"
