### Starting Event

ogre_events.1000.t:0 "Da Maw is Always Hungry"
ogre_events.1000.d:0 "We wasn’t always so fat an’ mighty. Long ago, we was just a big ol’ mob roamin’ the east, stompin’, eatin’, fightin’ — real good times. But then somethin’ big happened. Real big. Da sky split open and BOOM — down came da Great Maw, slammin’ into da earth like a god’s punch to the gut.\n\nIt ate our lands. Ate our people. Ate everythin’. And we saw it... an’ we knew. We wasn’t just born to eat. We was born to worship eatin’.\n\nNow we live in the mountains, near da hole where Maw hit. We fight each other, eat each other, and fight each other for eatin’ each other. But we also learned new tricks. We got caravans, we got muscle, and we got somethin’ better than lootin’ — protection money. Trade passes through our land, or it don’t pass at all.\n\nWe don’t care about crowns or books or shiny thrones. We care about meat. Coin. Respect. And most of all, fillin’ our bellies. Da Great Maw’s always hungry — and so are we.\n\nThis world’s full o’ tasty little empires. Let’s dig in."
