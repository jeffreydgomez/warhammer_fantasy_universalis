### Flavor Events

old_world_events.1.title:0 "Cultists in the Capital!"
old_world_events.1.desc:0 "Our trusted witch hunters have uncovered troubling signs of heretical activity in our capital. Hidden within shadowy corners and secretive dens, cultists conspire against the order of the Empire. Their foul rituals and dangerous beliefs threaten the purity of our faith and the stability of our rule.\n\nThe hunters report conflicting information about the cult's nature. How shall we respond to this growing threat?"
old_world_events.1.a:0 "A sexy Slaaneshi seducer!"
old_world_events.1.b:0 "A vicious vampiric vicar!"
old_world_events.1.c:0 "Even worse... A Bretonnian!"
old_world_events.1.d:0 "The bear people are drunk on our vodka again!"
old_world_events.1.e:0 "Who are these strange people, and what are they eating?"
old_world_events.1.f:0 "I don't care who it is. Kill them all!"


old_world_events.2.title:0 "A Beastmen Horde Approaches"
old_world_events.2.desc:0 "From the dark forests beyond our borders, a horde of beastmen has emerged, their monstrous shapes silhouetted against the flames of burning villages. These vile creatures, spawned from chaos, bring ruin and destruction wherever they go. Our scouts report that they are moving toward one of our provinces, intent on devastation.\n\nThe people demand action, but there are no easy solutions. We could muster the troops to repel them, though casualties will be severe. Alternatively, some suggest bribing certain beastmen leaders to redirect their warbands, but this risks emboldening their kind further."
old_world_events.2.a:0 "Drive them off with force!"
old_world_events.2.b:0 "Pay off the few who will take it."

old_world_events.3.title:0 "Secrets Among the Elector Counts"
old_world_events.3.desc:0 "At a recent meeting of the Elector Counts, one of our agents overheard a most interesting piece of information. It could be a rumor, a hidden scandal, or a poorly kept secret that could be exploited to strengthen our political position. The question is: what should we do with this knowledge?\n\nWe could use it to blackmail the offending party, gaining leverage over their house. Alternatively, we could act with honor and refrain from exposing them, perhaps earning their gratitude. Of course, we could also dismiss the matter entirely, refusing to stoop to such petty tactics."
old_world_events.3.a:0 "Blackmail, of course."
old_world_events.3.b:0 "Let's not embarrass them."
old_world_events.3.c:0 "We are above all this."

old_world_events.4.title:0 "Birth of a Mage"
old_world_events.4.desc:0 "A child has been born in our capital, demonstrating exceptional magical potential even at a young age. Such a rare gift is a blessing to the Empire, and the College of Magic has already expressed interest in guiding this young prodigy. However, others suggest that the child could be trained to harness their power on the battlefield, directly aiding in the Empire’s defense.\n\nThe decision is not to be taken lightly. Shall we entrust the child to the scholars of the Colleges, place them in our armies, or let them decide their own path? Whatever we choose will shape the future of the Empire and its connection to the winds of magic."
old_world_events.4.a:0 "Send her to the College of Magic."

old_world_events.5.title:0 "A Bretonnian Knight Challenges Us!"
old_world_events.5.desc:0 "A knight of Bretonnia has crossed the border into our lands, claiming to be a living legend and demanding a duel with one of our finest warriors. The knight declares that the honor of his lady compels him to test the mettle of the Empire’s champions. Such arrogance cannot go unanswered.\n\nDo we accept this challenge, risking humiliation—or perhaps even the loss of one of our greatest generals? Alternatively, we could refuse the duel, though this would surely diminish the Empire’s reputation in the eyes of its people."
old_world_events.5.a:0 "Accept the duel!"
old_world_events.5.b:0 "Reject the duel."

old_world_events.6.title:0 "Secrets at a Bretonnian Tournament"
old_world_events.6.desc:0 "At a grand tournament in Bretonnia, one of our agents uncovered a damning piece of information about a noble house. It could be a scandal or a political scheme, but it is a treasure trove of knowledge for anyone who wishes to exploit it. How should we proceed?\n\nWe could use this information to blackmail the noble house, gaining leverage over their court. Alternatively, we could act with grace, using this knowledge to build diplomatic goodwill. Or perhaps we should rise above such petty schemes entirely, preserving the Empire’s dignity."
old_world_events.6.a:0 "Blackmail, of course."
old_world_events.6.b:0 "Let's not embarrass them."
old_world_events.6.c:0 "We are above all this."

old_world_events.7.title:0 "Witch Hunts Across the Empire"
old_world_events.7.desc:0 "Fear grips the Empire as rumors of heresy and chaos cults spread like wildfire. The witch hunters demand full authority to purge any who are suspected of harboring dark secrets, but their zeal risks turning neighbor against neighbor. Already, arrests and accusations have begun to rise.\n\nShall we strike with fury, supporting the hunters in their efforts to root out corruption? Or should we encourage discretion to avoid unnecessary bloodshed? We could also dismiss the hysteria entirely, though this may embolden those who would undermine the Empire."
old_world_events.7.a:0 "Strike with fury!"
old_world_events.7.b:0 "Be forceful, but discreet."
old_world_events.7.c:0 "There's nothing to be afraid of."

old_world_events.8.title:0 "Ratmen in the Walls?"
old_world_events.8.desc:0 "Strange scratching sounds echo through the walls of our cities, and rumors of ratmen in the shadows have begun to spread. The superstitious whisper of Skaven, a vile race of rat-like creatures that many refuse to believe even exist. While the government has long dismissed such claims, the mounting evidence is hard to ignore.\n\nDo we act to investigate these rumors, even at the risk of creating panic? Or do we dismiss such fears and continue to deny the existence of these verminous fiends?"
old_world_events.8.a:0 "The ratmen are everywhere! Time to panic!"
old_world_events.8.b:0 "There's no such thing as ratmen!"

old_world_events.9.title:0 "Mutants in the Provinces"
old_world_events.9.desc:0 "Reports of twisted mutants terrorizing the countryside have reached the court. The dark taint of chaos appears to have taken hold, warping both the land and its people. Villages have been abandoned as the terror spreads, and the local populace is gripped with fear.\n\nWe must act swiftly to restore order. Shall we purge the corruption with fire and steel, risking devastation to the land? Or should we empower our missionaries to root out the heretics more carefully? Perhaps we should simply let the local rulers handle this matter themselves."
old_world_events.9.a:0 "Burn the cultists to the ground!"
old_world_events.9.b:0 "Activate the witch hunters."
old_world_events.9.c:0 "No need to panic. We will handle this through normal means."

old_world_events.10.title:0 "The College of Magic's Transmutation"
old_world_events.10.desc:0 "The College of Magic has offered to transmute iron into gold using their mastery of alchemy. Such a process could be highly lucrative, but it is also fraught with risk. The mine must be restructured for the alchemical process, and failure could lead to significant damage—or worse.\n\nShall we allow the College to proceed, risking devastation for potential riches? Or do we decline, keeping our iron and avoiding unnecessary dangers?"
old_world_events.10.a:0 "Take them up on it."
old_world_events.10.b:0 "We'll keep our iron, thanks."

old_world_events.11.title:0 "Magical Snowstorms Ravage the Land"  
old_world_events.11.desc:0 "A furious snowstorm has descended upon the land, tearing through villages and freezing the lifeblood of the kingdom. Some believe this is a sign of Ursun's displeasure, a punishment for our failures to honor the Great Bear. Others whisper that the Ice Witches have unleashed their magic recklessly, losing control over their blizzards.  \n\nThe howling winds and icy devastation threaten to bring ruin to our people. A great sacrifice to Ursun may calm his wrath, but this would require substantial resources. Alternatively, we could endure the storm's fury, rebuilding what is lost when the snow settles. Yet, perhaps we could harness this storm and send it hurtling toward our enemies, turning disaster into opportunity."  
old_world_events.11.a:0 "Do a sacrifice to please him."  
old_world_events.11.b:0 "Ride out the storm."  
old_world_events.11.c:0 "Great Ursun, turn this storm on our enemies!"  

old_world_events.12.title:0 "Conjure the Blizzard"  
old_world_events.12.desc:0 "The Ice Witches of Kislev have devised a daring plan. Through an immense ritual, they claim they can summon a magical blizzard of unparalleled ferocity, one that could engulf entire armies and devastate our foes. However, this spell is not without risks. The ritual requires a great deal of power, and if it were to spiral out of control, the resulting devastation could harm our own lands as much as our enemies'.  \n\nThe court debates the wisdom of this plan. Some argue the risk is far too great, while others see it as a necessary gamble to protect Kislev in these dark times. Will you give the witches the resources they need to unleash the storm, or restrain their magic in the name of caution?"  
old_world_events.12.a:0 "It's too risky."  
old_world_events.12.b:0 "Unleash the storms!"

old_world_events.100.desc:0 "Once more, the Electors have gathered in the grand halls of Altdorf, draped in silks they can scarcely afford and armed with grievances they are all too eager to voice. They proclaim their undying loyalty to the Empire, swearing oaths to its glory and the wisdom of its ruler—yet their true purpose is plain to see. Each Count seeks gold to line their treasuries, men to fill their ranks, or favors to cement their own power. They bicker and argue like children at a feast, each convinced that their province alone shoulders the weight of the Empire’s survival.\n\nThe air is thick with honeyed words and veiled threats, promises of future support given in exchange for immediate generosity. They claim hardship, war, and misfortune have left them destitute, yet their robes remain embroidered with gold and their goblets never empty. If the Emperor gives freely, they will take all they can, their gratitude as fleeting as morning mist. But if their demands are refused? Then whispers of discontent will spread through their courts, and the foundations of the Empire will grow a little weaker still."
