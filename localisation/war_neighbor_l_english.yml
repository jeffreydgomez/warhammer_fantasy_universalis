 neighbor_events.1.t:0 "Trickery Across the Border"
neighbor_events.1.d:0 "Having Tileans as neighbors is a mixed blessing. A group of merchants from [neighbor_country.GetName] have crossed into [target_province.GetName], where they deceived our local traders and made off with significant profits. While their actions were unscrupulous, their techniques were undeniably clever. Now we must decide how to respond."

neighbor_events.1.option_1:0 "Capture the merchants and take their goods."
neighbor_events.1.option_2:0 "Keep our money! But learn their methods."
neighbor_events.1.option_3:0 "Invite them back! [target_province.GetName] is a lovely place."

neighbor_events.2.t:0 "Wandering Cossacks"
neighbor_events.2.d:0 "From the snow-bitten steppes of [neighbor_country.GetName], a band of hardened Cossacks has crossed the border into [target_province.GetName]. Though their reputation as fierce warriors precedes them, these men appear leaderless, perhaps exiled or disillusioned. With their sabers slung low and horses gaunt from travel, they seek either war or welcome.\n\nTheir presence causes unease among the peasantry, but the military eyes their hardened frames with interest. Should we turn them away, send them back to [neighbor_country.Monarch.GetTitle] [neighbor_country.Monarch.GetName], or draw them into our fold?"

neighbor_events.2.option_1:0 "Press them into service. We need strong arms."
neighbor_events.2.option_2:0 "Send them home. [neighbor_country.Monarch.GetTitle] [neighbor_country.Monarch.GetName] will owe us a favor."
neighbor_events.2.option_3:0 "Grant them land in [target_province.GetName] and bind their loyalty to us."

neighbor_events.3.t:0 "Estalian Captain’s Tales"
neighbor_events.3.d:0 "An old Estalian sea dog, barnacled in medals and sunburnt to leather, has landed near [target_province.GetName] with a retinue of tattered sailors. Their tales speak of krakens off the coast of Sartosa, lost isles shrouded in mist, and trade winds no chart dares mark. The people are captivated, and even our navigators gather to hear his words.\n\nThe man, a native of [neighbor_country.GetName], seeks no gold, only a place to rest and recount his voyages. Perhaps we can offer more than rest—perhaps [target_province.GetName] could be his new harbor."

neighbor_events.3.option_1:0 "Thank him for the stories and bid him fair winds."
neighbor_events.3.option_2:0 "Make him mayor of [target_province.GetName]. The sea's loss is our gain."

neighbor_events.4.t:0 "Norscan Shadows on the Horizon"
neighbor_events.4.d:0 "A strange sight gathers on the border near [target_province.GetName]: a Norscan host, complete with wives and children, battered longships in tow. They seem not the usual raiders, but wanderers—perhaps refugees, or a warband sundered from its clan. Their eyes speak of hunger and exile, and yet their weapons are not far from reach.\n\nThe people fear them, the soldiers prepare. The court is divided: are they threat, opportunity, or both? [neighbor_country.GetName] makes no move to claim or confront them."

neighbor_events.4.option_1:0 "Offer gold. If they serve us, they live."
neighbor_events.4.option_2:0 "Expel them! We’ll not host chaos-born."
neighbor_events.4.option_3:0 "Offer them sanctuary in [target_province.GetName]. A new beginning, under our rule."

neighbor_events.5.t:0 "Albion’s Wayfarer"
neighbor_events.5.d:0 "A druidic seafarer from the mists of [neighbor_country.GetName] has made landfall near [target_province.GetName]. His vessel is crude, yet it holds charts unknown to our scholars—paths guided by stars and spirits alike. He speaks in riddles and verse, of ley lines and tides of fate, his presence both unsettling and mesmerizing.\n\nHe seeks neither conquest nor coin, only calm and communion. The people of [target_province.GetName] are already gathering to hear him. Shall we send him on, or allow his roots to grow here?"

neighbor_events.5.option_1:0 "Wish him well on his journey. May his path be clear."
neighbor_events.5.option_2:0 "Let him stay in [target_province.GetName]. Let his wisdom shape the land."

neighbor_events.6.t:0 "The Prophet of the Dunes"
neighbor_events.6.d:0 "A wandering prophet from [neighbor_country.GetName], robed in golden silk and accompanied by learned scribes, has arrived in [target_province.GetName]. He preaches the unity of all under the One True God, recounting visions seen beneath the moonlit dunes of Araby. His band of followers is disciplined and scholarly, well-versed in numerology, tactics, and theology.\n\nThe people are torn—some fearful, others awestruck. Though his beliefs are foreign, the prophet offers not conquest, but enlightenment. What shall we do with these holy men of the sands?"

neighbor_events.6.option_1:0 "Turn them away. We have our own gods."
neighbor_events.6.option_2:0 "Their warcraft is impressive. Let them teach us."
neighbor_events.6.option_3:0 "Their knowledge is deep. Let them instruct our sages."
neighbor_events.6.option_4:0 "They are welcome to settle in [target_province.GetName]."
neighbor_events.6.option_5:0 "Let the prophet tutor my heir in secret."

neighbor_events.7.t:0 "An Imperial General Seeks Peace"
neighbor_events.7.d:0 "From the war-torn heartlands of [neighbor_country.GetName] comes a grizzled general, his armor dented, his eyes heavy with sorrow. He claims to have fought in a hundred battles and now desires nothing more than a quiet life. [target_province.GetName] caught his eye, a place where he hopes to escape the weight of history.\n\nRumors swirl that he may still hold influence among the soldiers of [neighbor_country.GetName]. Perhaps he brings more than just a sword and weariness."

neighbor_events.7.option_1:0 "Before you rest, train our armies one last time."
neighbor_events.7.option_2:0 "He is a deserter. Return him to [neighbor_country.Monarch.GetTitle] [neighbor_country.Monarch.GetName]."
neighbor_events.7.option_3:0 "Shelter him in [target_province.GetName], and prepare a place for his followers."

neighbor_events.8.t:0 "The Hung on the March"
neighbor_events.8.d:0 "A raiding band of Hung has established a camp on the border near [target_province.GetName]. Their movements are erratic, but their numbers swell by the day. They make no demands—yet—but the threat they pose is clear to all.\n\nFrom [neighbor_country.GetName] they have spilled forth like a tide, bringing with them a storm of Chaos. To ignore them is to invite disaster. Yet perhaps they can be bent to our purpose."

neighbor_events.8.option_1:0 "Pay them off—anything to avoid a raid."
neighbor_events.8.option_2:0 "Show them our soldiers and steel. They'll think twice."
neighbor_events.8.option_3:0 "Hire them as mercenaries. Better to face them with us than against us."
neighbor_events.8.option_4:0 "Let them settle in [target_province.GetName], but at great risk to order."

neighbor_events.9.t:0 "The Kurgan Approach"
neighbor_events.9.d:0 "The Kurgan, fearsome horsemen from the distant east, are seen massing near [target_province.GetName]. Their black banners flutter and their scouts ride close to our frontier. [neighbor_country.GetName] remains silent, perhaps fearful or complicit.\n\nThe presence of these raiders threatens to unravel order. Yet not all among our advisors see them as a curse—some whisper of opportunity among the chaos."

neighbor_events.9.option_1:0 "Appease them with coin."
neighbor_events.9.option_2:0 "Mustering our troops will send a clear message."
neighbor_events.9.option_3:0 "We hire them. Chaos may yet be a blade we wield."
neighbor_events.9.option_4:0 "Allow them to stay in [target_province.GetName], and brace for unrest."

neighbor_events.10.t:0 "Darklanders at the Gate"
neighbor_events.10.d:0 "From the jagged lands of [neighbor_country.GetName], a ragged procession of Darkland humans approaches [target_province.GetName]. Though some bear arms, many are weary mothers, sick children, and stooped elders. They claim exile, not conquest.\n\nTheir presence evokes unease—memories of raids, black powder, and cruel treaties. But behind the fear is the question: will we drive them back, or offer them a new beginning?"

neighbor_events.10.option_1:0 "Buy their loyalty with coin and food."
neighbor_events.10.option_2:0 "Threaten them with arms. We won’t be caught off guard."
neighbor_events.10.option_3:0 "Grant them sanctuary in [target_province.GetName]."

neighbor_events.11.t:0 "Amazons on the Frontier"
neighbor_events.11.d:0 "A warband of Amazonian humans has appeared on the borders of [target_province.GetName], their spears grounded and their children huddled in woven cradles. Unlike typical raiders, they seem leaderless, their movements hesitant and their language thick with uncertainty. Stories speak of jungle gods abandoned and matriarchs slain.\n\nThough primitive by the standards of [neighbor_country.GetName], they possess an uncanny instinct for survival. They may be a threat—or a chance to integrate a hardy, if wild, people into our lands."

neighbor_events.11.option_1:0 "Offer them gold and sanctuary in return for service."
neighbor_events.11.option_2:0 "Chase them back to the jungles they came from!"
neighbor_events.11.option_3:0 "Welcome them into [target_province.GetName] as fellow mortals."

neighbor_events.12.t:0 "The Wandering Cathayan Sage"
neighbor_events.12.d:0 "A scholar from the venerable lands of [neighbor_country.GetName] has sought refuge within [target_province.GetName], cloaked in silence regarding his exile. He speaks of celestial harmonies, of arcane geometries, and bureaucratic perfection only found east of the Great Bastion. He offers knowledge freely, claiming that wisdom should outlive dynasties.\n\nThe court is divided—some urge caution, others see a golden chance to modernize. One man’s exile may be our realm’s ascension."

neighbor_events.12.option_1:0 "Let him reform our administrative code."
neighbor_events.12.option_2:0 "He shall teach our envoys the subtle dance of diplomacy."

neighbor_events.12.option_4:0 "Found a school in [target_province.GetName] and invite more like him."

neighbor_events.13.t:0 "Spice and Subterfuge"
neighbor_events.13.d:0 "From [neighbor_country.GetName] come merchants swathed in saffron robes and trailing the scents of cardamom and lotus. They barter with smiles and weighted scales, weaving contracts so intricate even our wisest clerks falter. In [target_province.GetName], their presence is growing—and with it, their influence.\n\nTheir zeal for the spice trade is matched only by their cunning. Do we push back, learn from them, or absorb them altogether?"

neighbor_events.13.option_1:0 "Seize their ledgers and wares!"
neighbor_events.13.option_2:0 "Study their methods discreetly."
neighbor_events.13.option_3:0 "Integrate them into [target_province.GetName] and profit from their trade."

neighbor_events.14.t:0 "The Grail Quest"
neighbor_events.14.d:0 "A knight of [neighbor_country.GetName], sworn to the Lady of the Lake, has arrived in [target_province.GetName], dusted with mud and crowned in piety. He speaks little, eats less, and asks only to be left to his sacred quest. His nobility is undeniable, and his blade bears not a nick.\n\nWe may gain prestige by treating him honorably—or power, if we were to exploit his presence."

neighbor_events.14.option_1:0 "Honor demands we treat him as a noble guest."
neighbor_events.14.option_2:0 "Delay him—just long enough to train our men in his ways."
neighbor_events.14.option_3:0 "Help him build a shrine to the Lady in [target_province.GetName]."
neighbor_events.14.option_4:0 "Strip him of coin and send him crawling back."

neighbor_events.15.t:0 "Envoys of the Mortuary Cult"
neighbor_events.15.d:0 "A procession from [neighbor_country.GetName], veiled in funerary silks and bearing gilded urns, has arrived at [target_province.GetName]. These are not tomb raiders, but emissaries of the Mortuary Cult, their gifts perfumed with embalming oils and wrapped in ancient linen. They offer gifts of jade and lapis, if we recognize the greatness of [neighbor_country.Monarch.GetTitle] [neighbor_country.Monarch.GetName].\n\nTheir arrival stirs awe and unease in equal measure. To engage with the undying empire is to invite ancient powers into our world."

neighbor_events.15.option_1:0 "Speak pleasantries, accept the gifts."
neighbor_events.15.option_2:0 "Send them away. We meddle not with the dead."
neighbor_events.15.option_3:0 "Rob them. Dead men carry no vengeance."
neighbor_events.15.option_4:0 "Establish a permanent embassy in [target_province.GetName]."

neighbor_events.16.t:0 "The Vampires Stir"
neighbor_events.16.d:0 "In the quiet hours before dawn, something moves in [target_province.GetName]. Livestock are found drained, and conscripts vanish without trace. Whispers of cloaked figures from [neighbor_country.GetName] slipping past border patrols have reached the court, their crimson sigils unmistakable.\n\nTo live beside the undead is to know fear and temptation. Their reach extends beyond their borders, and already the first seeds of their faith—or curse—begin to sprout in our soil."

neighbor_events.16.option_1:0 "They’ve taken our men. Curse them!"
neighbor_events.16.option_2:0 "Our herds are vanishing!"
neighbor_events.16.option_3:0 "The taint spreads. [target_province.GetName] falls to vampirism."
neighbor_events.16.option_4:0 "Tell me more of your 'immortality'..."

neighbor_events.17.t:0 "Tales from the Vampire Coast"
neighbor_events.17.d:0 "A pallid sea captain from [neighbor_country.GetName] has docked at [target_province.GetName], bringing with him a reeking crew and barnacle-covered treasures. He speaks of sunken empires and leviathan-slaying harpoons, all while swilling blood-wine from a broken goblet. The locals are both terrified and entranced.\n\nSuch visitors rarely come bearing goodwill—but rarely do they leave empty-handed either. How shall we deal with these salty revenants?"

neighbor_events.17.option_1:0 "Begone, foul revenants!"
neighbor_events.17.option_2:0 "Teach us the ways of sea and shadow."
neighbor_events.17.option_3:0 "Let them dock in [target_province.GetName]. The tide is already turning..."

neighbor_events.18.t:0 "Greenskin Marauders"
neighbor_events.18.d:0 "A surge of Greenskins from [neighbor_country.GetName] has flooded the outskirts of [target_province.GetName]. They loot, brawl, and guzzle fungus ale with equal enthusiasm. Yet among them are voices—loud, crude, and strangely articulate—calling for something more than mere violence.\n\nWe could fight them, pay them off, or try to harness their raw fury. But Greenskins are as volatile as they are brutal, and [target_province.GetName] already smolders from their passing."

neighbor_events.18.option_1:0 "Teach them civility—if that's even possible."
neighbor_events.18.option_2:0 "Entreat [neighbor_country.GetName] to call them off."
neighbor_events.18.option_3:0 "Recruit them! They’ll die for us instead."
neighbor_events.18.option_4:0 "Meet their violence with our own."
neighbor_events.18.option_5:0 "Bribe them to leave."

neighbor_events.19.t:0 "The Hobgoblins Approach"
neighbor_events.19.d:0 "Scouting reports confirm a band of Hobgoblins loitering near [target_province.GetName], their warg-mounted scouts darting in and out of our patrols. Unlike the mindless brutality of Orcs, these creatures trade, conspire, and enslave with practiced precision. [neighbor_country.GetName] has remained silent, perhaps unwilling or unable to leash them.\n\nWe must choose—resist, accommodate, or exploit. But Hobgoblins are treacherous, and trust is a dangerous currency."

neighbor_events.19.option_1:0 "Attempt to tame their ways—gods help us."
neighbor_events.19.option_2:0 "Plead with their khan for order."
neighbor_events.19.option_3:0 "Into the ranks! Their loyalty is negotiable."
neighbor_events.19.option_4:0 "Steel meets cunning—prepare for battle."
neighbor_events.19.option_5:0 "Pay them to disappear."

neighbor_events.20.t:0 "The Wrath of the Asrai"
neighbor_events.20.d:0 "Word has reached us from [neighbor_country.GetName]: one of our advisors has crossed into the sacred glades of the Asrai. They have been captured, and the forest kin intend to make an example of them. The advisor's life hangs by a thread of willow bark.\n\nThe Asrai do not forget, nor do they often forgive. Whether we abandon, plead, or retaliate, this moment will echo in [target_province.GetName] and beyond."

neighbor_events.20.option_1:0 "Let the trees have him."
neighbor_events.20.option_2:0 "Beg forgiveness, humbly and fully."
neighbor_events.20.option_3:0 "Reclaim him, but offer our regrets."

neighbor_events.21.d:0 "A delegation from [neighbor_country.GetName], refined and radiant, has arrived bearing gifts and a proposal to establish a permanent Asur diplomatic enclave in [target_province.GetName]. They speak of mutual enlightenment, magical concords, and cultural exchange through High Elven tradition. The embassy would be well-funded and impeccably maintained.\n\nThough not without cost, such a relationship may bring us into closer contact with the subtle arts and wisdom of Ulthuan. Some, however, whisper that the Asur never act without hidden purpose."

neighbor_events.21.option_1:0 "Graciously decline—our sovereignty must be respected."
neighbor_events.21.option_2:0 "Plunder their gifts and send them packing!"
neighbor_events.21.option_3:0 "Let the embassy rise in [target_province.GetName]."
neighbor_events.21.option_4:0 "Recruit their diplomats for our court, at a price."

neighbor_events.22.t:0 "Druchii Slave Raid"
neighbor_events.22.d:0 "A swift and vicious raiding party from [neighbor_country.GetName] has struck [target_province.GetName], dragging chained villagers into shadowy ships under moonlight. The Druchii strike without warning and vanish with cruel efficiency. Even now, the screams echo faintly through the morning mists.\n\nRetaliation, diplomacy, or appeasement? All seem bitter choices. But the people demand action—something must be done."

neighbor_events.22.option_1:0 "To arms! Strike them down!"
neighbor_events.22.option_2:0 "Let it go. We are not ready to face them."
neighbor_events.22.option_3:0 "Invite them to settle. Perhaps proximity will temper them."

neighbor_events.23.t:0 "Beastmen Gathering"
neighbor_events.23.d:0 "From the wilds of [neighbor_country.GetName], the stench of blood and musk drifts across the border into [target_province.GetName]. Horned silhouettes circle the woodlands, scrawling dark symbols and calling to the herdstones. Another raid seems inevitable.\n\nOur council fears them, the peasants loathe them, but they remain a brutal constant. Whether we bribe, battle, or—madly—integrate them, they must be addressed."

neighbor_events.23.option_1:0 "Try to civilize them—madness, but who knows?"
neighbor_events.23.option_2:0 "Appeal to their chieftains to leash the horde."
neighbor_events.23.option_3:0 "Recruit them. The enemy of our enemy..."
neighbor_events.23.option_4:0 "Prepare a counter-raid. Blood for blood."
neighbor_events.23.option_5:0 "Bribe them with gold and supplies."

neighbor_events.24.t:0 "Beastfolk Barterers"
neighbor_events.24.d:0 "Traders from [neighbor_country.GetName]—if one can call them that—have caused upheaval in the markets of [target_province.GetName]. These eastern beastfolk, furred and shrewd, use deceptive charm and exotic wares to outmaneuver local guilds. Their trade is legal, but barely so.\n\nSome among our merchants want them ousted. Others argue we should learn from them—or hire them outright. What’s the greater threat: their claws, or their coin?"

neighbor_events.24.option_1:0 "Seize their goods and teach them our laws."
neighbor_events.24.option_2:0 "Copy their tricks. It’s time we got smart."
neighbor_events.24.option_3:0 "Invite them to remain in [target_province.GetName] as official traders."

neighbor_events.25.t:0 "Snakefolk Raid"
neighbor_events.25.d:0 "From [neighbor_country.GetName], scaled figures have slithered across the border into [target_province.GetName], seizing workers and supplies in a sudden, coordinated strike. Their whispers sow panic, their venom paralyzes resistance. The Snakefolk do not speak—they simply take.\n\nThis cannot go unanswered. But how to deal with such a serpentine threat—strike back, concede, or turn invaders into neighbors?"

neighbor_events.25.option_1:0 "Attack now, before they disappear again."
neighbor_events.25.option_2:0 "Let them take what they want. We'll recover later."
neighbor_events.25.option_3:0 "Invite them to stay in [target_province.GetName]—perhaps we can tame them."

neighbor_events.26.t:0 "Fimir Slave Raid"
neighbor_events.26.d:0 "From the mists and bogs of [neighbor_country.GetName] come the Fimir, one-eyed horrors who now stalk the fields of [target_province.GetName]. Under cover of night, they seize livestock and villagers alike, dragging their captives into the swamp with cruel hooks and rusted chains. The air is thick with fear.\n\nOur people demand action. But these creatures are elusive and powerful—do we resist, retreat, or gamble on coexistence?"

neighbor_events.26.option_1:0 "Strike back with everything we've got!"
neighbor_events.26.option_2:0 "Let them have what they came for. We can’t afford this fight."
neighbor_events.26.option_3:0 "Perhaps they'd prefer to settle peacefully in [target_province.GetName]?"

neighbor_events.27.t:0 "Dwarven Delegation"
neighbor_events.27.d:0 "A delegation from [neighbor_country.GetName] has arrived with heavy axes, heavier coin, and plans for alliances, trade, and war. They speak plainly and proudly, proposing mutual aid and shared interests, forged in the fires of tradition and held fast by grudges and gold.\n\nHosting them will bring benefits—but also bind us to their rigid customs and long memories. How shall we proceed?"

neighbor_events.27.option_1:0 "Trade first! Let’s talk gold and roads."
neighbor_events.27.option_2:0 "Speak to us of axes and battle-lines."
neighbor_events.27.option_3:0 "Let us toast to glory and the tales that follow!"
neighbor_events.27.option_4:0 "No time for feasting. Send them away."
neighbor_events.27.option_5:0 "Establish a dwarven mining charter in [target_province.GetName]."

neighbor_events.28.t:0 "Chaos Dwarf Trade Charter"
neighbor_events.28.d:0 "A delegation of Chaos Dwarfs from [neighbor_country.GetName] has arrived, demanding the right to establish a trade charter in [target_province.GetName]. Their blackened forges burn hot, and their tongues speak of profits, not morality. Their contracts are intricate—and inevitably slanted.\n\nTo accept may enrich us. But it will also bring their cruel influence into our lands."

neighbor_events.28.option_1:0 "We want no dealings with those slavers!"
neighbor_events.28.option_2:0 "Sign the contract. Let their gold flow."
neighbor_events.28.option_3:0 "Let us renegotiate the terms—carefully."

neighbor_events.29.t:0 "Ogres, my Lord"
neighbor_events.29.d:0 "From [neighbor_country.GetName], a band of ogres has crossed the border, throwing their weight around in [target_province.GetName]. They bully merchants, extort traders, and consume foodstuffs in unholy quantities. Few dare challenge them, but the disruption to commerce is severe.\n\nSome say we should punish them, others suggest learning from their raw assertiveness—or even making them part of our own mercantile efforts."

neighbor_events.29.option_1:0 "Punish them! Let the merchants have their revenge."
neighbor_events.29.option_2:0 "We can adapt—what doesn't kill us sells better."
neighbor_events.29.option_3:0 "Let them settle in [target_province.GetName]. Their strength could serve us."

neighbor_events.30.t:0 "Tunnels Beneath Us"
neighbor_events.30.d:0 "The ground trembles beneath [target_province.GetName]. Rumors swirl of clawed creatures tunneling from [neighbor_country.GetName]—strange ratmen with bizarre machines and arcane lightning. The peasants whisper of skittering sounds at night, and more than one barn has collapsed mysteriously.\n\nIt is said the Skaven are myth, but myth does not shake the earth. Do we confront, exploit, or simply ignore the threat beneath our feet?"

neighbor_events.30.option_1:0 "Buy their technology, if we dare."
neighbor_events.30.option_2:0 "Ask their masters to leash their pets."
neighbor_events.30.option_3:0 "Into the army! They can be useful... expendably so."
neighbor_events.30.option_4:0 "Fight them now, before it’s too late!"
neighbor_events.30.option_5:0 "Let them tunnel. What’s the worst that could happen?"

neighbor_events.31.t:0 "The Scaled Prophets of the Old Ones"
neighbor_events.31.d:0 "A procession of Lizardmen from [neighbor_country.GetName] has crossed into [target_province.GetName], bearing sacred glyphs, ancient relics, and many warriors. They speak in hissing tones of the Old Ones and of restoring cosmic order. While they offer spiritual enlightenment, their spear-wielding escort suggests other motives.\n\nThe Slann assure us their presence is benevolent. But history teaches that wherever the Old Ones' designs manifest, upheaval follows."

neighbor_events.31.option_1:0 "Calmly ask them to leave. No need for bloodshed."
neighbor_events.31.option_2:0 "Drive them out before they sink their roots."
neighbor_events.31.option_3:0 "Let them preach in [target_province.GetName], but nothing more."
neighbor_events.31.option_4:0 "Permit them to build a great temple to the Old Ones."

neighbor_events.32.t:0 "The Roar of Khorne"
neighbor_events.32.d:0 "From across the border in [neighbor_country.GetName], the Blood God's presence presses upon our minds. Whispers turn to chants, and in [target_province.GetName], altars are scrawled in blood and skulls appear at crossroads. His promises are simple: strength in war, glory in death.\n\nSome say resist. Others say embrace his fury—if only for a time."

neighbor_events.32.option_1:0 "Witch hunters! Purge the heresy!"
neighbor_events.32.option_2:0 "Ignore the madness and hold fast."
neighbor_events.32.option_3:0 "Khorne's fury... perhaps we could use it."

neighbor_events.33.t:0 "The Decay of Nurgle"
neighbor_events.33.d:0 "A creeping malaise spreads from [neighbor_country.GetName] into [target_province.GetName]. Fields bloom then rot, and laughter turns to wet coughing. Yet those afflicted seem strangely content, as if suffering were a form of devotion. They call it the blessing of Nurgle.\n\nTo resist is costly. To embrace may be worse."

neighbor_events.33.option_1:0 "Purge them! Before the rot spreads!"
neighbor_events.33.option_2:0 "Steady—we’ll endure this."
neighbor_events.33.option_3:0 "The Plague Lord offers strength. Just a taste..."

neighbor_events.34.d:0 "From [neighbor_country.GetName] comes a surge of strange visions and sorcerous whispers. The skies over [target_province.GetName] swirl with unnatural hues, and spells miscast become potent. Followers of Tzeentch promise knowledge, change, and power—if only we dare accept it.\n\nBut all deals with the Changer of Ways come with hidden clauses..."

neighbor_events.34.option_1:0 "Root out the cult! Now!"
neighbor_events.34.option_2:0 "Do nothing. Let the wind pass."
neighbor_events.34.option_3:0 "Chaos is power. We shall use it."

neighbor_events.35.t:0 "The Temptation of Slaanesh"
neighbor_events.35.d:0 "From [neighbor_country.GetName], Slaanesh's whispers tickle our dreams. Perfumed caravans enter [target_province.GetName], bearing art, gold, and forbidden pleasures. Even now, nobles gather to partake in delights whispered of only in shadow.\n\nCan we resist the siren song of excess? Should we?"

neighbor_events.35.option_1:0 "Purge their indulgence with fire and steel!"
neighbor_events.35.option_2:0 "Ignore them. We are stronger than this."
neighbor_events.35.option_3:0 "Perhaps... a little indulgence is harmless."

neighbor_events.36.t:0 "The Followers of Nagash"
neighbor_events.36.d:0 "A caravan from [neighbor_country.GetName], cloaked in bone-laden finery, arrives to [target_province.GetName]. They claim to speak for [neighbor_country.Monarch.GetTitle] [neighbor_country.Monarch.GetName], offering dark gifts, sacred texts, and gems mined from forgotten tombs.
