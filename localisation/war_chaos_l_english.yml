chaos_nations_events.1.title:0 "The Dark Whisper"  
chaos_nations_events.1.desc:0 "In the quiet shadows of your halls, dark whispers slither through the minds of the faithful. These voices promise power, glory, and unparalleled strength if only you embrace their maddening bargains. The Ruinous Powers always seek to tempt their followers, testing their devotion and hunger for dominance.\n\nThe offer is enticing, but the cost of accepting their gifts could unravel your kingdom. Will you resist the whispers, or succumb to the lure of power, no matter the consequences?"

chaos_nations_events.2.title:0 "Mutations in the Ranks"  
chaos_nations_events.2.desc:0 "Your warriors are changing. Twisted shapes and grotesque appendages have begun to appear among your soldiers, gifts—or curses—bestowed by the Chaos Gods. These mutations bring enhanced strength and resilience, but their unsettling forms sow fear and discontent among the less devout.\n\nThe priests call these warriors the chosen of the gods, blessed to serve as elite instruments of destruction. However, others argue that such abominations must be purged to preserve discipline and morale."

He demands recognition and a place among your closest circle, claiming he will lead your armies to unrivaled victory.\n\nHowever, the power he wields is dangerous, and his ambitions could rival your own. Will you grant him the glory he craves, or sacrifice him to the gods to ensure your rule remains uncontested?"

chaos_nations_events.3.b:0 "Sounds like a threat. Sacrifice him to the gods."  

chaos_nations_events.4.title:0 "Rituals Out of Control"  
chaos_nations_events.4.desc:0 "The cults of the Chaos Gods have grown increasingly elaborate in their rituals, constructing massive ceremonies with grand sacrifices and wild celebrations.

Whatever choice you make, the Ruinous Powers will be watching."

The god of pleasure promises unparalleled beauty, skill, and perfection for those who submit to his will.\n\nWill you convert your realm to the worship of Slaanesh, grant him praise as a token of devotion, or dabble in his gifts while remaining loyal to your current path?

His gifts promise vitality and eternal life, even as they transform the bodies of his followers into bloated vessels of disease.\n\nWill you embrace Nurgle’s path and let decay strengthen your rule, or simply offer token devotion to ward off his wrath? The blessings of Nurgle may bring stability to your land, but they could also spread despair."  
chaos_nations_events.6.a:0 "It is a sign to convert."  
chaos_nations_events.6.b:0 "Praise to Nurgle!"  
chaos_nations_events.6.c:0 "A little worship on the side couldn’t hurt."

The Lord of Skulls offers unmatched strength to those who dedicate themselves to eternal battle in his name. His followers promise glory on the battlefield, but at the cost of peace and stability.\n\nWill you convert your nation to the worship of Khorne, praise him as your war god, or cautiously dabble in his gifts while trying to maintain control?"

chaos_nations_events.8.desc:0 "The Changer of Ways, Tzeentch, offers his blessings of knowledge, manipulation, and arcane power. His gifts are unpredictable, reshaping reality itself to suit his will. However, to accept his favor is to embrace constant flux and risk losing everything to his ever-changing schemes.\n\nWill you embrace Tzeentch fully, praise him for his gifts, or experiment with his power while trying to avoid his manipulations? The Lord of Change always has his plans."

chaos_nations_events.9.title:0 "The Chaos of Worship"  
chaos_nations_events.9.desc:0 "The worship of Chaos Gods often leads to unforeseen consequences. Your government is rife with self-serving individuals, civil unrest brews, and loyalties shift as the Ruinous Powers test their followers. The gods demand conflict and upheaval, and your realm is no exception.\n\nWill you allow chaos to spread, tolerate the corruption within your administration, or attempt to restore order by putting down dissenters? The cost of each path may be steep, but the gods demand a choice."

Whatever path you choose, their gaze will not be turned away easily."  
chaos_nations_events.10.a:0 "Of course! Will blood do?"
