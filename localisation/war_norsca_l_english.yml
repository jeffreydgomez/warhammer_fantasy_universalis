gen_norsca_albion_crown_title:0 "The Crown of Albion"
gen_norsca_albion_crown_desc:0 "With the conquest of Albion complete, its fate lies in our hands. We could rule the isle directly, but the distance from our homeland would stretch our reach thin.

Around each monolith, legions of thralls are stationed, blissfully ignorant of the doom that awaits them. At the appointed hour, they are led into formation beneath the shadow of the stone, watching in silent awe as we tear open a rift in reality… and seal their fate. Their minds will shatter, their flesh will twist, and from their ruin will rise abominations forged in the gods’ image.

flavor_norscan_events.4.b.tt:0 "The Norscan gods are an eclectic host of spirits and true divines, often embodied by beasts and rarely named, lest we draw their gaze. For generations unknowable, we have worshiped this fractured pantheon, eking out a meager existence in the barren lands of Norsca. Today, we offer thralls and gold upon their altars, hoping to earn their fleeting favor — or at the very least, delay their wrath. In this grim balance, survival can only be measured in blood-soaked altars and whispered prayers."

While many of our kin are content to ruin the land in service of dark gods, we have seen the cost of such madness firsthand — we have fought skinchangers, burned countless stillbirths, and watched rivers run black with blood. We will offer thralls to the land itself, not the false gods, until the rivers run red once more, not with decay, but with renewal. In doing so, we shall awaken the spirit of Norsca and ready it for the great struggle against the true enemy, the Dark Gods of Chaos."

Their voice quivered as they fell to their knees before [Root.Monarch.GetName], breathless from the run and trembling with the weight of revelation. “I have seen it,” they cried, eyes sightless, as though still caught within the vision. “A host beyond counting, singing the song of dead men—yours, my lord, leading them towards the final battle.” Their voice rose, thick with dread and reverence. “And at your side, a mighty daemon, bound to your will—your shield, your wrath, your equal in ruin.” The air in the chamber seemed to still, as though reality itself dared not interrupt what had been foretold."

flavor_norscan_events.7.khorne:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] stood in the pit, blood streaming down his face, its sharp taste lingering on his tongue, while the stench of rotting flesh twisted in his gut. His body, clad only in a loincloth, was caked in layers of coagulated blood, a brutal testament to his savage victories. The pit stretched eighty yards wide and eight deep, a grotesque sea of severed heads, eight thousand, eight hundred, and eighty-eight warriors, each felled in bloody combat. Each battle had sent his heart into a frenzied roar, and as he dropped into the sea of skulls, he felt the air thin around him, as though he could tear down the veil between this world and the void itself with nothing but his bare hands."
flavor_norscan_events.7.tzeench:0 "​In the heart of the royal council chamber, [Root.Monarch.GetName] stood at the center of nine vast concentric circles, each meticulously drawn with powdered incense, ivory dust, and the blood of countless sacrifices. For nine days, ninety-nine slaves had been offered to the dark forces, their lifeblood staining the sacred ground as fed the great ritual. Now, as the final moments approached, the air around [Root.Monarch.GetName] grew unnaturally thin, a palpable tension pressing against his chest. It was as if the very fabric between this world and the void had become fragile, ready to tear at his command. He could feel the power surging through him, the culmination of days of sacrifice and incantation, ready to bridge the realms with his will alone.​"

For the past six days, the establishment had been host to an orgy of six hundred and sixty-six sacrifices, unspeakable acts staining the very walls of the chambers as they met their glorious end. Now, as the ritual neared its climax, the air around [Root.Monarch.GetName] grew unnaturally thin, as if the veil between this world and the void had become impossibly fragile. With every heartbeat, the boundary between realms seemed to weaken, poised to shatter at his command. He could feel the power surging, a dark tide ready to consume all in its path."

The air was thick with the stench of putrefaction, suffocating and rancid, yet [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s senses sharpened, drawn to the subtle, pervasive shift in the very essence of the space. The air itself seemed to thin and warp, as if the fabric between this world and the void beyond had withered to the brink of nothingness. With each pulse of his heart, the boundary between the realms deteriorated further, as if it were but waiting to collapse at his command. A dark, insidious power surged through him, ready to rip open the veil and engulf all that remained in corruption and ruin."

[Root.Monarch.GetName] stood at the center of the storm, exulting in its power as the shaman's ancient chant summoned the first syllables of death itself. Blood arced through the air as the northern champions offered their victims, and severed heads tumbled into the pit, bouncing across the rotting carpet of skulls. A towering vortex of crimson mist rose skyward, a bridge of blood between the mortal realm and the throne of endless slaughter. [Root.Monarch.GetName] longed to ascend, to offer his blade in eternal war, but this moment belonged to something older something that now stepped through the veil. As the sky cracked and boiling blood filled the pit, [Root.Monarch.GetName] screamed in agony, his flesh burning as the avatar of Khorne entered the world through him.\n\nToo late, he realized his mistake.\nHis role in this was not to fight alongside a lord of Khorne.\nHis role was to become one."

[Root.Monarch.GetName] stood at the heart of a vast sigilic nexus, its shifting lines etched in shimmering dust and molten ink upon a floor that refused to stay still. The air shimmered with arcane heat as the shamans chanted in a tongue never spoken the same way twice, their voices weaving paradoxes that bent thought and unraveled time. Reality writhed as a thousand eyes blinked open in the void above, and a storm of impossible color tore the sky apart. As [Root.Monarch.GetName] raised his arms to welcome the Lord of Change into the world, the skeins of fate had already come undone.\n\nToo late, he understood his mistake.\nHis role was never to shape Tzeentch's will.\nHis role was to be remade by it."

[Root.Monarch.GetName] stood at the center of a spiraling temple of flesh and velvet, its walls pulsing with life, its geometry impossible to follow for long without surrendering to madness. Silken-clad priestesses moaned liturgies in voices too beautiful to bear, their tones threading ecstasy with agony until the two became indistinguishable. The air was thick with incense and anticipation, vibrating with the heartbeat of something divine, something that hungered to be adored, to be worshiped, to be felt. As [Root.Monarch.GetName] opened his arms to receive the Keeper of Secrets, pleasure and pain flooded through him in equal measure, stripping away identity with every breath.\n\nToo late, he realized his mistake.\nHis role was never to touch divinity.\nHis role was to be consumed by it."

[Root.Monarch.GetName] stood knee-deep in a pit of bloated corpses, their bodies slick with filth and riddled with worms, the stench so thick it clung to the soul. Around him, plague-priests droned in gurgling tones, their chants gurgling like pus as they praised the Grandfather’s endless generosity. Flies swarmed in halos above their heads, and the pit churned with life—new life, joyous and rancid—as the veil between worlds rots away. As [Root.Monarch.GetName] opened himself to the Lord of Decay, warmth spread through his limbs—not fire, but a slow, crawling bloom of infection that filled him with grotesque peace.\n\nToo late, he realised his mistake.\nHis role was never to spread Nurgle’s gifts.\nHis role was to become them."
