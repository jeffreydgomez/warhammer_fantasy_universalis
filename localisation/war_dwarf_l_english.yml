### Events
  dwarf_events.0.t:0 "Insult on the Battlefield"
  dwarf_events.0.d:0 "One of our enemies has gone beyond the bounds of respectful combat and dared to utter a slur against us in the heat of battle. We are neither 'stumpies,' nor shall we forget this dishonor!"
  dwarf_events.0.a:0 "Oh, that's a grudge"
  dwarf_events.0.b:0 "Maybe he said ...  bumpies?"

    dwarf_events.1.t:0 "An Insult From Afar"
dwarf_events.1.d:0 "One of our envoys kneels before us, shaking with incandescent rage. Silent, he hands you a gold-embroidered scroll bearing the seal of a foreign name.\n\nThe missive starts well enough: 'Mighty King, tales of your great deeds are told from Lustria to Cathay.' It continues on in flowery praise for several paragraphs, until you reach the end. Then, your eyes go wide.\n\n'Yes, my king,' the envoy says, struggling to keep his voice calm. 'Now you come to the atrocity.'\n\nHe takes a deep breath. 'They have spelled your name wrong.'"
  dwarf_events.1.a:0 "That's a grudge!"
  dwarf_events.1.b:0 "But, is it?"


  dwarf_events.2.t:0 "An Insult to the Beard"
  dwarf_events.2.d:0 "Your cousin bursts into your private chamber, his face flushed red and his beard bristling with fury. He grips his tankard so tightly you fear it might buckle. 'My king!' he bellows, his voice echoing off the stone walls. 'You will *not* believe the insult I have just suffered at that diplomatic gathering!'\n\nBefore you can respond, he launches into his tale. 'The foreign envoy, after his flowery talk of "our noble mountains" and "your eternal wisdom," looked me dead in the eye and said that *I*—ME!—should "trim my beard to better reflect the refinement of Dwarven culture!"'\n\nHe slams the tankard on the table, sending ale sloshing onto the floor. 'A clear insult, my king! To my beard! To my honor! To all Dwarfs! I demand this goes into the Dammaz Kron. This *must* be a grudge!' His fiery glare dares you to suggest otherwise."
  dwarf_events.2.a:0 "Certainly a grudge!"
  dwarf_events.2.b:0 "Perhaps it was a misunderstanding?"

  dwarf_events.3.t:0 "Two Pennies Short"
  dwarf_events.3.d:0 "Word has reached your throne of an outrage at the market. One of your merchants, red-faced and fuming, recounts the events. 'My king,' he begins, his voice trembling with indignation. 'While trading with foreign merchants, I discovered they'd shorted me two pennies on the agreed payment! Two whole pennies!'\n\nHe slams a coin pouch onto the floor for emphasis, scattering coins across the stone. 'This wasn’t an accident, I tell you. Those wretched outsiders think we’re fools! That we wouldn’t notice! This is an insult to Dwarven honor, my king. If we let this stand, they’ll think they can cheat us again!'\n\nThe merchant’s companions mutter in agreement, nodding their bearded heads with grim expressions. 'What will you do about this slight, my king?' they ask, their voices thick with expectation."
  dwarf_events.3.a:0 "That's a grudge!"
  dwarf_events.3.b:0 "It's just two pennies... let it go."


dwarf_events.4.t:0 "A Name Forgotten"
dwarf_events.4.d:0 "During a council meeting, one of your advisors nervously approaches, clearly uncomfortable about what he’s about to say. 'My king,' he begins, carefully choosing his words. 'It seems that during an exchange of letters, a foreign emissary addressed you merely as "King ," omitting your full and proper title.'\n\nThe room falls silent as his words sink in. Murmurs spread among the gathered Dwarfs, their faces darkening with anger. 'They failed to acknowledge your full station, my king!' one of your thanes exclaims, thumping his fist on the table. 'No "Defender of the Holds," no "Lord of the Everlasting Peaks," no "Keeper of the Great Vaults!" An insult to your honor and the glory of our ancestors!'\n\nAnother voice rises above the others. 'If we let this slide, what next? They’ll be calling you just "dwarf" before long!' All eyes turn to you, waiting for your judgment."
dwarf_events.4.a:0 "Get the book!"
dwarf_events.4.b:0 "We cannot expect them to get it right"

dwarf_events.5.t:0 "An Affront to Tradition"
dwarf_events.5.d:0 "The hall is abuzz with gossip and indignation. During last night’s feast, a visiting noble caused an uproar by openly spurning the finest Dwarven ale for a goblet of Elven wine they brought with them. The memory is still fresh in the minds of those present, and one of your most senior brewmasters stands before you, his face a picture of wounded pride.\n\n'My king,' he says, his voice shaking with barely contained anger. 'I offered them the best of our reserves—beer brewed from the purest mountain springs, aged in stone casks, and blessed by the master brewers themselves! And they had the gall to say, "I prefer something lighter" and produced that Elven swill!' He spits the last words like venom.\n\nThe brewmaster pauses, his fists clenched. 'This isn’t just about beer, my king. This is about respect. For our traditions. For our craft. For *Dwarvenkind*. Surely, this warrants a place in the Dammaz Kron!' The gathered court murmurs their agreement, waiting to see how you will respond."
dwarf_events.5.a:0 "That's a grudge!"
dwarf_events.5.b:0 "Perhaps they simply have poor taste."

dwarf_events.6.t:0 "Time Wasted on Formalities"
dwarf_events.6.d:0 "Your diplomat returns looking thoroughly exasperated. His beard is unkempt, his eyes bloodshot, and his temper barely contained. 'My king,' he begins, bowing stiffly. 'It is with great restraint that I report this outrage without throwing my axe into their gates.'\n\nHe takes a deep breath to compose himself. 'The entire visit was a farce! Instead of discussing trade agreements or military pacts, they subjected me to endless rituals and formalities. Hours of bowing, reciting irrelevant titles, exchanging meaningless platitudes… and in the end, they refused to commit to anything!' He slams his fist on the table, his frustration palpable.\n\n'I wasted weeks in that court, *weeks!* And for what? To hear a dozen versions of "We’ll consider your proposal" while they debated what color the banners should be for the next feast! My time, my king—*our time*—was disrespected. Surely, this must go in the Dammaz Kron!' The court nods solemnly, muttering about foreign incompetence and lack of respect, as they await your decision."
dwarf_events.6.a:0 "That's a grudge!"
dwarf_events.6.b:0 "It’s irritating, but hardly grudge-worthy."
