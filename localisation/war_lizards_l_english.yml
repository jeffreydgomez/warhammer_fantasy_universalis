### Events

lizardmen_events.1.title:0 "Temple Robbing"  
lizardmen_events.1.desc:0 "Two skinks have been caught red-handed stealing golden tablets from one of the temple vaults, sacred artifacts that are the key to deciphering the Great Plan of the Old Ones. These traitorous creatures have even been selling their stolen treasures for profit, a heinous offense that threatens the integrity of our ancient traditions. Their crime has sparked outrage among the priesthood and sent shockwaves through the temple cities.  \n\nSome demand that these skinks be executed immediately, their punishment serving as an example to deter future transgressors. However, others argue that the stolen treasures could be put to better use by the state, especially given our current needs. And then there are those who see opportunity in this misdeed—why not send these rogues to acquire more riches, regardless of the dishonor?"  
lizardmen_events.1.a:0 "Kill them, and return the loot."  
lizardmen_events.1.b:0 "Kill them and keep the loot."  
lizardmen_events.1.c:0 "Go get some more!"  

lizardmen_events.2.title:0 "The Glory of the Lizardmen"  
lizardmen_events.2.desc:0 "The greatness of the Lizardmen is beyond question. As the chosen protectors of the Great Plan, we alone stand as the guardians of the world against the forces of Chaos and disorder. Our unmatched discipline, strength, and wisdom set us apart from the feeble mortals and their petty ambitions. The temple cities echo with the hymns of our glory as the skink priests remind the masses of our divine purpose.  \n\nBut what truly defines us? Is it our unyielding defense of the Great Plan and the world it seeks to preserve? Perhaps it is the perfection of the Old Ones' design, or the unity of our people, who serve without question. The choice is yours to define what makes us supreme."  
lizardmen_events.2.a:0 "We are the true protectors of the world."  
lizardmen_events.2.b:0 "The Old Ones' design is perfect."  
lizardmen_events.2.c:0 "Our people are unified."  

lizardmen_events.3.title:0 "The Corruption of the Nexus"  
lizardmen_events.3.desc:0 "The geomantic web that links our temple cities to the power of the Old Ones is behaving strangely. The nexus stones that channel the celestial energies now pulse with chaotic light, and the skink priests report wild visions and uncontrollable bursts of power. This corruption threatens to unravel the sacred balance of the Great Plan, and the priesthood grows divided on how to proceed.  \n\nSome demand that the corruption be purged immediately, no matter the cost. Others argue that this new power could be harnessed, empowering us to greater heights. Yet, there are also whispers of greed and ambition, calling for more of this tainted energy, regardless of the consequences. What path shall we take?"  
lizardmen_events.3.a:0 "Purge the corruption at all costs."  
lizardmen_events.3.b:0 "Harness the tainted power."  
lizardmen_events.3.c:0 "More power!"  

lizardmen_events.4.title:0 "Feral Spawnings"  
lizardmen_events.4.desc:0 "The sacred spawning pools have produced a new generation of warriors, but something about them is deeply unsettling. These new spawnings are larger and more powerful than ever before, yet their minds are consumed by primal instincts. They hiss and claw even at their kin, and their aggression makes them uncontrollable on the battlefield.  \n\nThe priests are unsure if this is a gift of the Old Ones, granting us monstrous champions, or a curse brought on by Chaos taint. We could allow these spawnings into our armies to harness their immense strength, though it would risk sowing discord. Alternatively, we could destroy them and cleanse the pools to prevent further corruption."  
lizardmen_events.4.a:0 "Let them into the army."  
lizardmen_events.4.b:0 "Destroy these abominations, and the pools themselves."  

lizardmen_events.5.title:0 "Visions of Doom"  
lizardmen_events.5.desc:0 "One of the Slann Mage-Priests has entered a deep meditative trance, muttering cryptic warnings of an apocalyptic future. His visions speak of great calamities, chaotic storms, and the collapse of the geomantic web. While the skink priests insist these are genuine messages from the Old Ones, others fear the Slann's mind has been tainted by Chaos.\n\nThis is a critical moment. If the visions are genuine, uniting the temple cities and preparing for the foreseen danger is paramount. However, if the Slann has been corrupted, his influence must be removed to prevent further harm. The fate of our people may hinge on this decision."  
lizardmen_events.5.a:0 "They are genuine visions. We must unite."  
lizardmen_events.5.b:0 "He's been corrupted by Chaos! Kill him!"  

lizardmen_events.6.title:0 "The Jungle Hungers"  
lizardmen_events.6.desc:0 "The jungles surrounding the temple cities have grown unnaturally restless. The trees twist into warped shapes, vines writhe like living things, and wild beasts stalk the shadows with a ferocity never before seen. The skink scouts report that the jungle seems alive with malice, as though the very land has been tainted by Chaos.\n\nThe jungle poses a clear threat to our settlements. We could send hunters to clear out the corrupted beasts, but this will cost valuable lives. Alternatively, we could allow the jungle to run its course and adapt to its new, untamed state, though this would bring devastation to the surrounding lands."  
lizardmen_events.6.a:0 "Send hunters to clear it out."  
lizardmen_events.6.b:0 "Let the jungle run its course."  

lizardmen_events.7.title:0 "Feral Instincts Run Wild"  
lizardmen_events.7.desc:0 "Something has awakened a primal fury within the Lizardmen of the temple cities. Across the land, warriors and citizens alike are overcome by feral instincts, abandoning their duties to fight and claw at one another. The skink priests are unable to calm the frenzy, and chaos threatens to engulf the cities if the situation is not addressed.\n\nThe council is divided on how to respond. Some believe the army must be sent in to restore order, though this would cost lives. Others suggest that the frenzy should be allowed to burn itself out naturally. There are even whispers of encouraging the mayhem, letting the strongest survive in the name of the Great Plan."  
lizardmen_events.7.a:0 "Send in the army!"  
lizardmen_events.7.b:0 "Encourage the mayhem."  
lizardmen_events.7.c:0 "Just... let it pass."  

lizardmen_events.8.title:0 "The Old Ones' Test"  
lizardmen_events.8.desc:0 "Deep within the jungle, a forgotten temple has suddenly awakened. The walls glow with celestial glyphs, and a surge of energy pulses from the ancient structure. The skink priests believe this is a test from the Old Ones, meant to challenge our resolve and prove our worth. However, the energies within are unstable and dangerous, teetering on the edge of chaos.\n\nWe could seal the temple and leave it undisturbed, ensuring the safety of the surrounding lands. Or we could enter the temple, risking everything to claim its secrets. The rewards could be immense, but so could the potential devastation."  
lizardmen_events.8.a:0 "Seal the temple and let it be."  
lizardmen_events.8.b:0 "Enter the temple and claim its secrets."  

lizardmen_events.9.title:0 "The Mutant Champion"  
lizardmen_events.9.desc:0 "A mutant saurus has emerged from the spawning pools, unlike any ever seen before. Towering above his kin and shimmering with chaotic energy, he is a natural-born leader whose strength and charisma inspire awe. However, his rhetoric borders on heresy, questioning the rigid structure of the Great Plan and sowing doubt among the warriors.\n\nThe priests demand his immediate execution, fearing the spread of corruption. Yet, some argue that he could be an invaluable asset, a champion to lead our armies against the enemies of the temple cities. What fate shall befall this extraordinary, yet dangerous, creature?"  
lizardmen_events.9.a:0 "Kill him!"  
lizardmen_events.9.b:0 "Make him a general."  


lizardmen_events.100.title:0 "The Future of Dinosaurs in Warfare"
lizardmen_events.100.desc:0 "For countless generations, the mighty beasts of the jungle—stegadons, carnosaurs, bastiladons—have formed the backbone of our armies. These sacred creatures were birthed by the will of the Old Ones, and their raw power has turned the tide of many battles. Yet as our military doctrines evolve, and as the tactics of warmblood invaders grow more complex, we must now determine how these ancient allies fit into the wars of tomorrow."

lizardmen_events.100.a:0 "Expand the role of the Dinosaurs."
lizardmen_events.100.b:0 "Focus on the Saurus infantry."
lizardmen_events.100.c:0 "Phase out the beasts, let the saurus lead."

 HOLY_SITE_2312_DESC: "Hexoatl, the "City of the Sun," is the northernmost temple-city, located on the Isthmus of Pahuax. It's Lustria’s first line of defence against Northern invaders. The Grey Guardians, a sentient mountain range created by Lord Mazdamundi can be found two hundred miles north of Hexoatl. Raised to block the Dark Elf armies that threaten to overwhelm the city, the mountains proved so effective that the Mage-Priest made the enchantment permanent."
 HOLY_SITE_2466_DESC: "tza, called the "First City," is the greatest of the surviving temple-cities of the Lizardmen and is home to the most powerful and ancient practitioners of magic to be found anywhere in the Known World. Foremost amongst them is the venerable Slann relic priest, Lord Kroak, whose indomitable spirit has guarded Itza against the return of Chaos since the Great Catastrophe. Although it has been hard-pressed on several occasions, never once has Itza yielded to an attacker."
 HOLY_SITE_2442_DESC: "Quetza, also known as "the Defiled," is an abandoned Lizardmen temple-city that served as a powerbase for the Skaven of Clan Pestilens during their sojourn in Lustria."
 HOLY_SITE_4296_DESC: "Zlatlan, the "Hidden City," is the greatest Lizardmen temple-city within the Southlands and one of the few that remains intact and inhabited by the Lizardmen on that continent. The Slann mage-priests of Zlatlan are unable to maintain contact with those of Lustria via telepathic links because of the curvature of the earth. The Slann communicate thoughts and magical energy along lines traced out across the jungle from one pyramid to another. The expanse of the World Pond and the curve of the world's surface prevent such a line between Lustria and the Southlands."
 HOLY_SITE_4807_DESC: " This settlement that lies in the centre of the jungles of Khuresh was one of the temple-cities created by the Old Ones to accomplish their Great Plan with the help of their foremost servants, the Lizardmen."
 HOLY_SITE_4265_DESC: "Similar to the temple-cities of the Southlands, the Lizardmen colonies on the Dragon Isles were cut off from their masters many centuries ago, but the degradation of their culture was much more rapid and pronounced. Without any Slann to lead them, the local Skinks and Saurus have reverted completely to barbarism, becoming little more than beasts and destroying what little remained of their former glory in bitter conflict. Whether the Slann of Lustria have attempted to establish communications with the lost kin or have simply abandoned them to their fate is unclear, but certainly there has been little or no contact between Lustria and the Dragon Isles for hundreds of years."
 HOLY_SITE_4383_DESC: "A Lizardmen temple-city stands on the Volcanic Isles, different from all others in Lustria. It is not a "living" city, nor was it abandoned. Rather, the City of the Dead is a necropolis, home to the Lizardmen's honoured dead. These Skinks, Saurus, and occasionally Kroxigor are honoured with an interment in the City of the Dead, watched over by those Relic Priests with no temple-city of their own."
 HOLY_SITE_4261_DESC: "Nestled deep within the verdant and hostile jungles of the Dragon Isles, this ancient Lizardmen temple city stands as a testament to the Old Ones' divine design."
