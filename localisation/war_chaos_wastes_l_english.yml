It is an insult to the gods, a defiance of entropy itself! The Elves call it their triumph, their eternal vigil against the tide. Fools! They do not see the truth—the Vortex is not a bastion, it is a dam, and all dams must break!\n\nIts power hums beneath our feet, a caged beast straining against ancient wards. We shall tear those bindings asunder. We shall unmake the last hope of order, rip open the sky, and let the storm of Chaos drown the world. The boundary between flesh and nightmare will dissolve, and the gods will walk once more. No more barriers. No more illusions. No more reality—only the eternal, boundless glory of the immaterial!"

Even the stars will one day flicker and fade into the void. We, the chosen of Chaos, are not builders—we are harbingers of that final truth.\n\nLet the fools of civilization claw desperately at the edges of decay, erecting walls of stone and words to stave off the collapse. They think themselves masters of this reality, architects of permanence. But we know better. Entropy cannot be denied.\n\nSome among us say we must simply let the world rot, that decay needs no hand to guide it. Others whisper that we must hasten the unraveling, that the gods of Chaos demand more than passive waiting. It does not matter. What is destined shall come to pass.\n\nRide forth, let the fires of war spread, and tear down the illusions of stability. The first stones have already begun to crack—now we must bring the whole structure down."

Blood and fire! Death and ruin! The gods are never sated, and neither am I!\n\nMy hands shake, not with fear, but with hunger! There is no end—only the slaughter, only the burning, only the blessed, blessed sound of it all crashing down! My warband surges forward, not as soldiers, not as warriors, but as a storm of flesh and steel! We are not men. We are not beasts. We are CHAOS!

Even the brightest fire can be snuffed out—or twisted into something far greater.\n\nThis is no mere pyre. It is a tether, anchoring the hearts of men to the illusion of order, to the lie of strength and purity. But we shall rewrite its purpose. We shall defile its sacred embers, feed it with the essence of the immaterial, and let it burn not as a light of resistance, but as a beacon to the gods! The veil will thin, the world will wail, and in the end, the Flame shall consume all, as it was always meant to!"

But we have seen the truth—there is no balance, no order, no harmony. There is only the lie of stability, delaying the inevitable collapse!\n\nThis device does not merely guide rulers; it holds the world in check, a cosmic fulcrum upon which Cathay, and all who believe in order, foolishly rest. We shall turn its mechanisms to the gods’ design, shatter its delicate alignments, and send the heavens spiraling into madness! The sky shall crack, the stars shall weep, and the veil shall be no more. What was once a compass will become a gateway, and through it, Chaos shall flood into all things!"
