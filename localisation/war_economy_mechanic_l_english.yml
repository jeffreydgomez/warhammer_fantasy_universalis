 flexible_industry_focus_desc:0 "The structure of an industrial economy is inherently flexible, yet deeply influenced by the demands of war and peace. In times of calm, production is geared toward growth, infrastructure, and commercial expansion. But when war erupts, the same machinery is swiftly redirected—supply chains are reconfigured, quotas adjusted, and civilian tools reforged into instruments of war. This dynamic focus ensures national survival and dominance in an era defined by steel and fire."
