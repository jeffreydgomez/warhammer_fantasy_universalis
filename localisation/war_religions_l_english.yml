 desc_order_of_silver_hammer:0 "The Order of the Silver Hammer includes both warrior priests and witch hunters. Its warrior priests are almost always found wearing yellow-detailed black robes over protective leathers. Sacred breastplates—emblazoned with griffons, comets or crosses—and wide, high-necked gorgets are the preferred choices for armour, but cheaper chainmail is often worn in their stead. Hair is commonly shaved when a novitiate is elevated to the order, although some priests allow patches to grow back, where they carefully shave holy symbols or solemn liturgies."
 desc_order_of_anvil:0 "The Order of the Anvil is the Cult's monastic wing, whose members live in worldly isolation and preserve Sigmar's deeds and law. Its different monasteries vary in their required garb and hairstyles. Simple grey or black habits are common, although brown is known in the east of the Empire, and green or orange are worn in some isolated monasteries of Talabecland and Reikland. Hair is usually shaved, with novitiates tonsured, but this again varies, with some monasteries demanding that hair grow wild, have stripes shaved through it, or be caught in hundreds of tight braids. Wide, high-necked collars are also common, mirroring the gorgets of the warrior priests."
 desc_order_of_torch:0 "The massive Order of the Torch, the largest of the Cult's orders, comprises the local Sigmarite clergymen all across the Empire. In terms of vestment, is even more diverse. Black robes may be the standard, with brown and grey also common, but some temples wear white, orange, red or even purple robes, as dictated by local traditions and superstitions—although each variance requires, at some point, permission from the Grand Theogonist. High, wide collars are again common, although far from universal, as are shaved heads. The typical hammers, comets, griffons, holy seals and prayer parchments are usually displayed in one fashion or another, although some temples teach that such open displays of faith idolise the objects rather than glorifying Sigmar. Another common tradition is to wear holy books, sometimes at the waist, sometimes upon the back, as a symbolic burden. This is taken to extremes by some priests, who wear miniature holy texts on their foreheads to protect their minds from heresy, tying them in place with strips of leather."
 desc_order_of_cleansing_flame:0 "The smaller Order of the Cleansing Flame is made up of inquisitors and witch hunters. It tightly controls its ceremonial dress in the same way it carefully monitors its members. Robes are black, detailed in red, and hair is cropped close to the skull, with elaborate tonsures sported by ranking members of the order. Floor-length, hooded, black cloaks are also worn, although novitiates may not raise the hood. Unlike the other primary orders, this ceremonial garb is normally only worn on important occasions. When travelling, Cleansing Flames wear whatever clothes allow them to fulfil their order's purpose, which include dressing in the garb of other orders, or disguising themselves as peasants or travelling merchants. No matter what they wear, all members of the order own a holy amulet with a single flame in its centre; this is the badge of their order, used to prove they are on Sigmar's business."
 desc_templar_fiery_heart:0 "The Knights of the Fiery Heart are a lesser knightly order in service to the Cult of Sigmar, serving as the personal bodyguard of the Grand Theogonist. They often vie with Knights Griffon for political power within the High Temple of Sigmar."
 desc_templar_sigmars_blood:0 "The Knights of Sigmar's Blood are an order of templars with a long and proud history in service to the Cult of Sigmar. They are led by Grand Master Hans Leitdorf, brother of the late Elector Count of Averland, Marius Leitdorf."
 desc_templar_knights_griffon:0 "The Order of the Knights Griffon are a knightly order founded by Magnus the Pious just following the Great War Against Chaos. They are tasked with protecting Temples of Sigmar, in particular the Holy Temple of Sigmar in Altdorf. They recruit only from the local nobility of Nuln."

 myrmidia_religion_desc:0 "Myrmidia is the primary and patron goddess of Tilea and Estalia. She is the goddess of honourable war, civilisation, strategy, soldiers, vengeance, beauty, art and honour. In the year 2502 IC, the Cult of Myrmidia is experiencing a schism between the Tilean and Estallian branchs of the Cult. They each have very different perspectives on several major views about the goddess and her lore, not helped by the fact that her three holy books each present very all different accounts of her origins and place varying emphasis on the importance of her story. \n\nMyrmidia is reported by some sacred texts to once have walked the earth clad in mortal flesh. Myrmidia would allegedly grow into a warrior maiden and rally the people of the southern Old World against all enemies. Tileans claim she was born in Remas and conquered Estalia, while the Estalians claim she was born in Magritta and conquered Tilea. Regardless of which version is true, she united the southern civilisations. The day she was crowned queen of the southern realms, however, she was assassinated. When Myrmidia lay dying from her wounds, she ordered a great ship be built, and, it is said, sailed west upon it, there to return to her home amongst the gods, known now, and forever after, as a goddess of war."

 ursun:0 "Great Orthodoxy"
 ursun_religion_desc:0 "The Great Orthodoxy is the organised state religion of Kislev, founded by Tzar Boris Bokha around 2480 IC.  Tzar Boris was concerned that the nature of religion in Kislev -- often taking the form of informal, widely divergent shamanistic rites overseen by wise women, witches and hags in rural areas -- put it at risk of being easily infiltrated and subsumed by the Dark Gods, thus allowing Chaos Cults to flourish. The Great Orthodoxy was thus formed as an attempt to organise, formalise, centralise and regulate traditional religion in Kislev, keeping the various religious cultsunder the strict and watchful eye of the centralised -- and government controlled -- Great Orthodoxy."

To this day, scholars still discuss whether Hashut is a true Chaos God, an upstart Great Daemon or something else, a primordial force that was spawned in the dawn of time. During the Great Cataclysm, the Ancestor Gods abandoned those that would become the Chaos Dwarfs, who found salvation in a new master, Hashut. In reward for centuries of devotion, He has gifted the Chaos Dwarfs with dark, sorcerous secrets. Sacrifices to Hashut are usually thrown into great, bull-shaped furnaces, where they burn to the death in His honour."
