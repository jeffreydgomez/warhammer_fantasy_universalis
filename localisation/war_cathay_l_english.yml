### Starting Events

cathay_events.100.t:0 "An Empire of Fractured Dominions"
cathay_events.100.d:0 "The Celestial Empire may span the vast lands of Cathay, but it is a patchwork of semi-autonomous dominions and powerful factions ruled by distant lords and ambitious magistrates. While all swear fealty to the Dragon Throne, loyalty is often tenuous and enforced more by tradition than unity. Many of these provinces quietly chafe under the mandate, dreaming of independence or even challenging the Emperor’s authority.\n\nHowever, the Dragon Empire has gone missing, and his empire is falling to pieces. To secure the Dragon Emperor's rule, the regent in the North must keep a watchful eye on these restless dominions and suppress the seeds of rebellion before they grow too bold.\n\n§RBuild trust and favors with domains, eventually converting them into more easily controlled vassals with the -Vassalize Dominion- influence action. Rebellious domains may attempt to make their overlord a domain. They they succeed, then all of their overlords dominions will be transferred.§"
cathay_events.100.a:0 "Cathay Will Endure!"


cathay_events.101.t:0 "Vamprism in Cathay"
cathay_events.101.d:0 "The Jianshi Court is recognized by the Dragon Empire, but our vampiric nature has been a cause of unease and suspicion among the living lords of Cathay. The mortal realms around us refuse to see the rightful place of the undead as masters over the living. Through careful diplomacy, conquest, and subtle influence, we shall one day take our rightful place as rulers of Cathay.\n\nFor now, we are tolerated only by the strict adherence to Cathayan protocol, yet this acceptance is brittle and temporary. We must forge alliances and turn mortal minds to our cause before this tolerance shatters.\n\n§RUse the -Convert Them- influence action or the -Implant Cults- spy action to spread vampirism throughout Cathay.§"
cathay_events.101.a:0 "Cathay Will Be Ours!"

claim_all_cathay_tt:0 "Gain Permanent Claims on all of Cathay."


cathay_events.102.t:0 "Return of the Monkey King"
cathay_events.102.d:0 "They thought they'd seen the last of me. Fools. When the Dragon Emperor vanished and the dragons tore each other apart, I rose — not by brute strength, but by wit, charm, and just a touch of chaos. For centuries, I sat on their throne, and oh, how it shined beneath me.\n\nThen came their return — Emperor, Empress, children united — and I was cast down, chased into the mountains like a common bandit. Ha! Let them have their moment. I’ve not been idle. High in the Mountains of Heaven, I have waited, watched, and laughed.\n\nNow the Emperor has vanished once again, and his children rule in his stead. Their empire is brittle beneath its painted veneer. Their pride blinds them. And me? I am the crack in the porcelain. I am the grin behind the mask. I am the rightful ruler of Cathay — and I shall return, not with armies, but with riddles and ruin.\n\nThe dragons will never see it coming."
cathay_events.102.a:0 "The throne will be mine again — one joke at a time."

dragon_blooded_personality:0 "Dragon-Blooded"
dragon_blooded_personality_desc:0 "Blessed with the blood of dragons, these individuals are a step removed from true divinity, yet far above mere mortals. Their presence stirs awe and ambition alike, for they are marked by destiny and carry the will of their celestial ancestors.\n\nWhile not of the Imperial Line, the Dragon-Blooded are natural leaders and wield their inherited grace with potent charisma, inspiring loyalty and reinforcing the supremacy of Cathayan culture."

cathay_events.50.t:0 "The Art of Porcelain, The Might of Empire"
cathay_events.50.d:0 "Cathay has long mastered the delicate craft of porcelain — but now we command its market. Foreign nobles clamor for our vases, and rival courts display our teacups as status symbols. Yet true mastery lies not only in beauty, but in purpose.\n\nOur artisans report new methods to reshape porcelain into instruments of strength: industrial kilns, alchemically-enhanced weaponry, and even lifelike statues ready for war. The question is not whether we can — but how best to use our supremacy."

Should we enlist their mounts, exploit their schemes, or simply bind them with promises? In Cathay, even monsters must find a purpose."

monkey_court:0 "The Monkey Court"
monkey_court_desc:0 "The Monkey Court is less a government and more a grand, endless performance. Intrigue, illusion, and improvisation dominate every corner of court life, where ministers are actors, envoys are spies, and truth is just another costume.\n\nEspionage and diplomacy flourish in this kingdom of masks, but bureaucratic order does not. Edicts vanish mid-scroll, taxes are forgotten in favor of punchlines, and administrators find themselves promoted one day and exiled the next — often for the crime of being too serious.\n\nYet, in the confusion lies cunning. The Monkey King thrives in chaos, and so too does his court, toppling empires with a whisper and swaying kingdoms through laughter. Just don’t expect the roads to get paved."

Others fear the eruption of false prophecy and unrest. The common folk are alight with emotion—how shall we respond?"

Shall we elevate his voice to authority, silence it through steel, or simply buy his loyalty?"
