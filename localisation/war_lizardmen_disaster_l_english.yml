# Events
unstable_rifts.0.t:0 "We Have Attracted the Ire of Chaos"
unstable_rifts.0.d:0 "The Geomantic Web is faltering. Despite the Slann's relentless efforts to stabilize it, cracks have begun to appear—not just in the fabric of the web, but in reality itself. By invoking the power of the Old Ones, we have drawn the ire of the Ruinous Powers. Lord Mazdamundi has declared a state of divine emergency, warning that the Chaos Gods now seek to unravel the Great Plan. Unstable rifts to the Realm of Chaos have begun to tear open across our lands, threatening to unleash daemonic incursions. Worse still, unknown warbands and cultist nations may emerge from these breaches to assail us. We must stand firm and shield the Slann, or all shall be consumed in madness."
unstable_rifts.0.a:0 "We must protect the Great Plan!"


unstable_rifts.1.t:0 "The Geomantic Web Restored!"
unstable_rifts.1.d:0 "After decades of brutal incursions, the Slann have succeeded in mending the sacred weave of the Geomantic Web. Its power shines more brilliantly than ever. The Old Ones watch over us—and we have proven our worth."
unstable_rifts.1.a:0 "The Old Ones have blessed us."

unstable_rifts.2.t:0 "A Rift Opens"
unstable_rifts.2.d:0 "A surge of Chaotic energy has been detected. A dimensional rift has torn open with one goal: to unravel the Great Plan. We must close it—at any cost."
unstable_rifts.2.a:0 "We must make the Old Ones proud!"

unstable_rifts.3.t:0 "The First Storm"
unstable_rifts.3.d:0 "The Chaos incursions have dragged on endlessly. Now, the gods of the Warp have sent yet more monstrosities to assail our realm. The first true storm is upon us."
unstable_rifts.3.a:0 "Let them come!"

unstable_rifts.5.t:0 "Chaos Infects a Spawning Pool"
unstable_rifts.5.d:0 "Nurgle’s foulness has seeped into one of our spawning pools. The waters churn with filth as twisted, oozing heretics emerge. Trees sprout eyes, grass festers into boils, and bones lie scattered beneath the mire. The corruption spreads like a second rift. What action shall we take?"
unstable_rifts.5.a:0 "Send a missionary to purify it."
unstable_rifts.5.b:0 "Purge the site immediately!"

unstable_rifts.6.t:0 "Tzeentchian Cult Discovered"
unstable_rifts.6.d:0 "A Slann has uncovered a dark ritual deep beneath one of our cities. The rite has just begun. The Slann proposes we allow the cult to continue momentarily—he believes we may learn much about Tzeentch’s designs. Shall we risk it?"
unstable_rifts.6.a:0 "Burn them all—no risk to the Great Plan."
unstable_rifts.6.b:0 "Observe them to gain insight."

unstable_rifts.7.t:0 "Temple Guard Close a Rift"
unstable_rifts.7.d:0 "A rift began to open near one of our settlements, spewing raw Chaos and lesser daemons. But thanks to a swift response from a Slann and Temple Guard reinforcements, it was sealed before it could widen. A minor victory—but a victory nonetheless."
unstable_rifts.7.a:0 "Claim this triumph."
unstable_rifts.7.b:0 "Let the Slann absorb the released magical energies."
unstable_rifts.7.c:0 "It is as the Great Plan foretold..."




unstable_rifts.8.t: "Blood Rainstorm"
unstable_rifts.8.d:0 "A torrential storm has swept across our lands—unusual, yet not unheard of. But soon the rains turned crimson. It was not symbolic. It was blood. The ichor soaked through everything: spawning pools, sacred granaries, and even temple foundations. The corruption it leaves behind reeks of Khorne’s mark. We must act swiftly."
unstable_rifts.8.a: "This is an ill omen from the stars."
unstable_rifts.8.b: "Cleanse the spawning pools before the corruption sets in."

unstable_rifts.9.t: "Gore-Feast Among the Spawn"
unstable_rifts.9.d:0 "Without warning, an entire cohort of Saurus turned upon each other in a frenzy of bloodshed. This was not battle-lust, nor a lapse in discipline—it was unnatural, ritualistic, and obscene. The survivors are drenched in gore, their eyes devoid of reason. Reinforcements arrived swiftly. But the damage may already be done."
unstable_rifts.9.a: "Purge them in the name of the Great Plan."
unstable_rifts.9.b: "Attempt to cleanse their minds and bodies."

unstable_rifts.10.t: "Advancement in Geomantic Restoration"
unstable_rifts.10.d:0 "After years of ritual supplication and arcane calculations, a conclave of Slann has identified a critical tear in the Geomantic Web—one that can be mended. They request the expansion of the local pylon network and access to rare ruination gems to anchor the repairs. The Old Ones have offered us a chance. How shall we respond?"
unstable_rifts.10.a: "Let them proceed at their own pace. Our resources are needed elsewhere."
unstable_rifts.10.b: "Divert some resources to aid the restoration effort."
unstable_rifts.10.c: "Commit everything. The Web must be healed!"


unstable_rifts.101.t:0 "Rift of Blood and Fury"
unstable_rifts.101.d:0 "The skies seethe with crimson light, and the earth cracks with the heat of raw hatred. A gate of ruinous power has torn open nearby, spewing forth warriors clad in brass and drenched in gore. These are not mere beasts—they are the chosen of Khorne, the Blood God. Their war cries echo across the jungle, and within a year, they will march to claim skulls for the Skull Throne. The Great Plan trembles as the scent of war fouls the air."
unstable_rifts.101.a:0 "They shall bleed for their trespass."

unstable_rifts.102.t:0 "Rift of Rot and Decay"
unstable_rifts.102.d:0 "A sickly green miasma rolls from a newly torn rent in reality. Swarms of flies blot out the sun, and diseased things crawl forth from the pit. These are the loathsome legions of Nurgle, the Lord of Plagues, who seek to drown the world in filth and despair. Already, corruption spreads unchecked, and within the year, their pestilent hosts will begin their assault. Even the geomantic web recoils from their touch."
unstable_rifts.102.a:0 "We must cleanse the filth."

unstable_rifts.103.t:0 "Rift of Schemes and Sorcery"
unstable_rifts.103.d:0 "A shimmering rift twists the fabric of the world, its light ever-changing and full of whispered lies. From it emerge sorcerers and horrors of impossible geometry—agents of Tzeentch, the Changer of Ways. Their arrival distorts fate itself, unraveling threads of the Great Plan. Within a year, they will unleash their magical onslaught, spreading madness and treachery across the land."
unstable_rifts.103.a:0 "Their deceit ends here."

unstable_rifts.104.t:0 "Rift of the Howling Warp"
unstable_rifts.104.d:0 "A storm of unnatural winds tears open the veil, howling with voices not of this world. From the breach come nightmarish beasts and shrieking warriors whose presence warps the minds of the weak. These invaders appear unbound to any known god—perhaps daemon-kin of a lesser Chaos Power. Within the year, their forays into our world will begin in earnest, spreading disorder and madness wherever they tread."
unstable_rifts.104.a:0 "The winds must be silenced."

unstable_rifts.105.t:0 "Spawn of Glastra Emerge"
unstable_rifts.105.d:0 "A rupture pulses with unstable power, leaking shadows and discord. From it pour the spawn of Glastra, a being of lunacy and mutation unrecorded by even the oldest plaques. Their madness spreads like wildfire, and within a year, they are expected to surge forth in erratic slaughter. Though alien, their essence is unmistakably tainted by Nurgle’s rot and ruinous will."
unstable_rifts.105.a:0 "We will hold firm against this anomaly."

unstable_rifts.106.t:0 "The Talzian Breach"
unstable_rifts.106.d:0 "The Talzian Ascor—a cabal of daemon-worshippers once banished by the Slann—have torn open a rift to the Realm of Chaos. Their chants pierce the veil, and the jungle festers under Tzeentchian corruption. Though not formally aligned, their magic bears the hallmarks of the Changer of Ways. It is foretold that within a year, they shall rise to strike at the sacred lands unless stopped."
unstable_rifts.106.a:0 "Their lies end with our blades."




unstable_rifts.110.t:0 "The War God's Whispers"
unstable_rifts.110.d:0 "The winds of Chaos howl with violent purpose. Visions of bloodshed, conquest, and annihilation pour through the rift, searing the minds of our warlords. The gods are impatient—their thirst must be sated. Our neighbors grow complacent, unaware that the storm is upon them. Now is the time to strike. Let the earth quake beneath our advance and the sky darken with fire and ash. There will be no warnings. Only war."
unstable_rifts.110.a:0 "Their lands will burn in the name of the gods."
