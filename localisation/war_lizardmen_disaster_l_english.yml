# Events
unstable_rifts.0.t:0 "The Slann Warn of a Catastrophe"
unstable_rifts.0.d:0 "The Geomantic Web is faltering. Despite the Slann's relentless efforts to stabilize it, cracks have begun to appear. In a rare proclamation, Lord Mazdamundi has declared a state of emergency. He speaks of divine strength granted by the Old Ones to delay the collapse—but warns of worsening times. Forces of Chaos are mobilizing to sabotage the Great Plan. We must unite and defend the Slann while they restore the sacred web."
unstable_rifts.0.a:0 "We must protect the Great Plan!"

unstable_rifts.1.t:0 "The Geomantic Web Restored!"
unstable_rifts.1.d:0 "After decades of brutal incursions, the Slann have succeeded in mending the sacred weave of the Geomantic Web. Its power shines more brilliantly than ever. The Old Ones watch over us—and we have proven our worth."
unstable_rifts.1.a:0 "The Old Ones have blessed us."

unstable_rifts.2.t:0 "A Rift Opens"
unstable_rifts.2.d:0 "A surge of Chaotic energy has been detected. A dimensional rift has torn open with one goal: to unravel the Great Plan. We must close it—at any cost."
unstable_rifts.2.a:0 "We must make the Old Ones proud!"

unstable_rifts.3.t:0 "The First Storm"
unstable_rifts.3.d:0 "The Chaos incursions have dragged on endlessly. Now, the gods of the Warp have sent yet more monstrosities to assail our realm. The first true storm is upon us."
unstable_rifts.3.a:0 "Let them come!"

unstable_rifts.5.t:0 "Chaos Infects a Spawning Pool"
unstable_rifts.5.d:0 "Nurgle’s foulness has seeped into one of our spawning pools. The waters churn with filth as twisted, oozing heretics emerge. Trees sprout eyes, grass festers into boils, and bones lie scattered beneath the mire. The corruption spreads like a second rift. What action shall we take?"
unstable_rifts.5.a:0 "Send a missionary to purify it."
unstable_rifts.5.b:0 "Purge the site immediately!"

unstable_rifts.6.t:0 "Tzeentchian Cult Discovered"
unstable_rifts.6.d:0 "A Slann has uncovered a dark ritual deep beneath one of our cities. The rite has just begun. The Slann proposes we allow the cult to continue momentarily—he believes we may learn much about Tzeentch’s designs. Shall we risk it?"
unstable_rifts.6.a:0 "Burn them all—no risk to the Great Plan."
unstable_rifts.6.b:0 "Observe them to gain insight."

unstable_rifts.7.t:0 "Temple Guard Close a Rift"
unstable_rifts.7.d:0 "A rift began to open near one of our settlements, spewing raw Chaos and lesser daemons. But thanks to a swift response from a Slann and Temple Guard reinforcements, it was sealed before it could widen. A minor victory—but a victory nonetheless."
unstable_rifts.7.a:0 "Claim this triumph and inspire morale."
unstable_rifts.7.b:0 "Let the Slann absorb the released magical energies."
unstable_rifts.7.c:0 "If they can spawn anywhere, raise the alarm!"




unstable_rifts.8.t: "Blood Rainstorm"
unstable_rifts.8.d:0 "A torrential storm has swept across our lands—unusual, yet not unheard of. But soon the rains turned crimson. It was not symbolic. It was blood. The ichor soaked through everything: spawning pools, sacred granaries, and even temple foundations. The corruption it leaves behind reeks of Khorne’s mark. We must act swiftly."
unstable_rifts.8.a: "This is an ill omen from the stars."
unstable_rifts.8.b: "Cleanse the spawning pools before the corruption sets in."

unstable_rifts.9.t: "Gore-Feast Among the Spawn"
unstable_rifts.9.d:0 "Without warning, an entire cohort of Saurus turned upon each other in a frenzy of bloodshed. This was not battle-lust, nor a lapse in discipline—it was unnatural, ritualistic, and obscene. The survivors are drenched in gore, their eyes devoid of reason. Reinforcements arrived swiftly. But the damage may already be done."
unstable_rifts.9.a: "Purge them in the name of the Great Plan."
unstable_rifts.9.b: "Attempt to cleanse their minds and bodies."

unstable_rifts.10.t: "Advancement in Geomantic Restoration"
unstable_rifts.10.d:0 "After years of ritual supplication and arcane calculations, a conclave of Slann has identified a critical tear in the Geomantic Web—one that can be mended. They request the expansion of the local pylon network and access to rare ruination gems to anchor the repairs. The Old Ones have offered us a chance. How shall we respond?"
unstable_rifts.10.a: "Let them proceed at their own pace. Our resources are needed elsewhere."
unstable_rifts.10.b: "Divert some resources to aid the restoration effort."
unstable_rifts.10.c: "Commit everything. The Web must be healed!"


unstable_rifts.101.t:0 "Rift of Blood and Fury"
unstable_rifts.101.d:0 "The skies seethe with crimson light, and the earth cracks with the heat of raw hatred. A gate of ruinous power has torn open nearby, spewing forth warriors clad in brass and drenched in gore. These are not mere beasts—they are the chosen of Khorne, the Blood God, and they march under banners soaked in slaughter. The Great Plan trembles as the scent of war fouls the jungle air."

unstable_rifts.101.a:0 "They shall bleed for their trespass."

unstable_rifts.102.t:0 "Rift of Rot and Decay"
unstable_rifts.102.d:0 "A sickly green miasma rolls from a newly torn rent in reality. Swarms of flies darken the sun, and diseased things crawl forth from the pit. Nurgle, the Lord of Plagues, sends forth his bloated children to corrupt the lands of order. Trees wither, rivers sour, and even the geomantic web recoils from their touch. This is an affront to all that is sacred."

unstable_rifts.102.a:0 "We must cleanse the filth."

unstable_rifts.103.t:0 "Rift of Schemes and Sorcery"
unstable_rifts.103.d:0 "A shimmering rift twists the fabric of the world, its light ever-changing and full of whispered lies. From it emerge sorcerers and horrors born of impossible geometry—agents of Tzeentch, the Changer of Ways. They bring madness, treachery, and arcane corruption that gnaws at the threads of the Great Plan. The Slann sense a terrible imbalance forming."

unstable_rifts.103.a:0 "Their deceit ends here."

unstable_rifts.104.t:0 "Rift of the Howling Warp"
unstable_rifts.104.d:0 "A storm of unnatural winds tears open the veil, howling with voices not of this world. From the breach come nightmarish beasts and shrieking warriors whose presence warps the minds of the weak. These invaders are not of any known order—perhaps Daemon-kin of a lesser Chaos Power or unaligned terrors. Their arrival spells disorder and madness."

unstable_rifts.104.a:0 "The winds must be silenced."

unstable_rifts.105.t:0 "Spawn of Glastra Emerge"
unstable_rifts.105.d:0 "A rupture pulses with unstable power, leaking shadows and discord. The spawn of Glastra—an entity of malice and lunacy—pour forth, bringing with them nightmarish visions and erratic slaughter. Though unknown to our oldest plaques, their corruption is unmistakably ruinous. The Slann convene in emergency convocation to assess this deviation."

unstable_rifts.105.a:0 "We will hold firm against this anomaly."

unstable_rifts.106.t:0 "The Talzian Breach"
unstable_rifts.106.d:0 "The Talzian Ascor—a cult of daemon-worshippers long sealed away in hidden prophecies—have breached reality. From their rift echo countless discordant chants, and the jungle wilts under unnatural energy. They bring with them no allegiance to a single Chaos God, but embody chaos unbound. They must be extinguished before their heresies spread."

unstable_rifts.106.a:0 "Their lies end with our blades."
