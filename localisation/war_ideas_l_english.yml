The Dark Apostle must entreat the Ruinous Powers and bind that denizen to his ferocious will, thus dragging it through the portal the Sorcerer has created. The Warpsmith's role is to provide the mechanical shell into which the daemon is bound, and to set the warding-chains upon it so that the daemon does not escape.\n\nIn some cases, those who seek to create the Daemon Engine are dragged through the portal they have created and cast adrift upon the tides of the Warp, their bodies torn apart in seconds by the predators of that unreal dimension, their souls fed upon for all eternity.

 A03_idea_2:0 "Hochlander Tolerance"
 A03_idea_2_desc:0 "Hochland is pretty diverse in the gods worshipped, as Taal and Rhya are obviously both very popular due to the forests covering the province, but a significant following of Ulric and Sigmar can also be found throughout the province.

 A03_idea_3:0 "Hardy Woodsmen"
 A03_idea_3_desc:0 "Hochlands armies differ from most of the empire's armies found in other provinces like Reikland and Ostland, since its military is primarily suited for small skirmishes and forest fighting, rather than the large open battles that would take place elsewhere in the Empire."

The logs are then bought by brokers, loaded on barges, and shipped out. "
 A03_idea_6:0 "T  he Kind Men of Hochland"
 A03_idea_6_desc:0 "Hochlanders are pretty friendly, as their province is heavily traveled by people crossing or visiting so are a pretty nice bunch of people to be around, though other provinces have suggested that this if from open-eyed naivete because Sigmar forbid someone in the Empire is just nice to other people."

 A07_idea_5:0 "Eaters of Anything"
 A07_idea_5_desc:0 "Notoriously thrifty, Ostlanders are known for their ability to survive. Said to be capable of eating anything, there are several mocking songs about the famous ‘Stone soup of Ostland’ They are so creative in their frugality that a common joke in the Empire claims that Ostlanders make ‘stone soup’ with only one stone, for fear of wasting good rocks."
 A07_idea_6:0 "A Bastion of Sigmar"
 A07_idea_6_desc:0 "Ostlanders, like most Imperials, honour all the gods and celebrate their feast days. If one god is favoured over another, however, it is Sigmar, who is worshipped with a degree of devotion not often seen in the east of the Empire. Surrounded by lands that lean toward Ulric and Taal and Rhya, few know why this is so, though many offer explanations. Devout Ostlanders say it stems from the time when, soon after the founding of the Empire, a great dragon ravaged Ostland. The other electors and their armies were afraid to face the beast, so Sigmar came alone and killed it after a great fight alongside the Ostland Count. On the other hand, cynics suggest that Ostlanders are so devoted because their “poor cousin” Electors have to keep borrowing money from wealthy Reiklanders and thus need to keep them happy. Whatever the truth, it is a fact that even the smallest Ostlander village sports multiple shrines to Sigmar"

The Stir is both a well-travelled trade route and the entire northern border of Stirland.

 A08_idea_5:0 "Talabeclander Fury"
 A08_idea_5_desc:0 "At their best, Talabeclanders are patient woodsfolk, with a quiet intensity and honour. Talabeclanders, even their nobility, are unusually self-effacing for an Imperial people.

 A09_idea_1_desc:0 "Once a mighty city that could rival many others within the Empire, Mordheim grew decadent with corruption, and as these multitudes gathered for the arrival of the Twin-Tailed Comet, it is said that Sigmar judged them false and smited the city, killing all those left within.\n\nNow, it is a dead city, where only the foolish, mad or greedy seek to venture forth, either to plunder the riches of the ruins or to covet the green shards of comet-borne Warpstone that lace the entire city with its corruption.\n\nWhile, in 2302 IC, Emperor Magnus the Pious led a mighty Imperial army to the city and burnt its cursed ruins to the ground after his victory over the forces of Chaos, Ostermark still has plenty of Mercenary contacts in the West"

 A09_idea_2_desc:0 "Ostermark is like a miniature of the Empire, a league of free and independent towns relying on each other for mutual security. We have to—no one else in the Empire cares a fig about us.\n\n —Chancellor Wolfram Hertwig, Elector Count of Ostermark"
 A09_idea_3:0 "Mixture of people"
 A09_idea_3_desc:0 "At the formation of the Empire Adelhard, leader of the Ostagoths, and his warriors took wives and mistresses from among the people of Averland, Stirland, and Talabecland upon their march home. These women were the first of many new bloodlines to come into the region, now named Ostermark.\n\nTo this mixture were added Ungol elements during the invasions of the mid-18th century IC, bringing a horse-raising culture to Ostermark's Veldt region. Kislevites would cross the border, too, though more as settlers than conquerors, fleeing the cruelties of their tsar or natural disasters such as famine or drought. All these elements blended to form a people who, while still recognisably Imperial in culture and language, showed distinct differences from their more western cousins."
 A09_idea_4:0 "The Death's Head"
 A09_idea_4_desc:0 "The halberdiers known as the Death's Heads were founded during the Vampire Wars. They began in the town of Essen, Ostermark during the rule of Vlad von Carstein. Those who dared to speak up against Vlad, let alone partake in armed resistance, soon disappeared, so in order to protect their identities, the first Death's Heads wore skulls as masks.\n\nThe Death's Heads became famous after freeing Essen during a rebellion. Later, they took part in the Battle of Hel Fenn. Today the Death's Heads recruit not only from Essen, but all over Ostermark."

 A09_idea_7:0 "Hertwig's Folly"
 A09_idea_7_desc:0 "In the year 2485 at the Battle of Black Road Wolfram Hertwig, Elector Count of the Ostermark, stubbornly refused to allow the Grand Master of the Knights of the Everlasting Light to take command of his army, though Hertwig was barely into his teens and had never commanded an army in battle. In response, Grand Master Kessler and his warriors rode back to their chapter house leaving Hertwig's army to fight the invading Orcs without their aid. \n\nThough the greenskins were eventually defeated, the count's army suffered horrific losses and for many years, the Ostermark was dependant on aid from the armies of Ostland or Talabecland for its survival. Needless to say, Hertwig's Folly (as it has now become known) stands as a cautionary tale to those who would allow ego to blind them to the value of having the greatest warriors of the Empire fighting alongside them."

A Tilean condottiero like many others, Colombo is also an accomplished marksman, navigator, explorer, adventurer, commander, merchant, diplomat and the most fashionable in Lustria; at least, according to his biographers. Be as it may, his skills led him to become a famed general, the Prince of Trantio in Tilea, and one of the few beings in existence with a usable line of contacts with the Slanns of Lustria, or at least their Skink chiefs, a line that goes all the way up to Lord Mazdamundi himself nevertheless.\n\nNot unlike when treating with Dwarfs, a single faux pas can lead to not only economic collapse of a valuable trade line, but also utter destruction. Colombo is well-aware of the fact, and handles his contacts personally and carefully. In exchange for exorbitantly valuable items, Colombo leads his forces against any such marauding foe that the lethargic Lizardmen don't have the initiative to handle directly, such as Dark Elves or other pirates. With that in mind, Colombo also has little patience for other humans who constantly put his privileged trade partnership at risk with their callous greed, as opposed to his own well-managed fine taste."

 A55_idea_1_desc:0 "Although unassailable from outside, Tobaro was not so secure from within and its extensive and uncharted network of tunnels proved to be its bane. Skaven forces attacked the city from below in a series of raids between IC 1563 and 1565, razing large parts of the city and enslaving much of the populace.\n\nThe Prince of Tobaro, Meldo Marcelli, managed to escape with many of his soldiers and most of his ships. Arriving in Remas he spent all his wealth hiring a great army of mercenaries, including a strong contingent from Remas. Returning without delay, and reinforced by a contingent of Sea Elves, the force succeeded in entering the harbour unnoticed and sneaking into the city, catching the Skaven unawares and driving them back, driving them back into the catacombs. There followed further bitter fighting within the rock of the acropolis before all the Skaven were finally cleared.\n\nFighting between the Tobarans and the Ratmen continued on and off for many years with countless skirmishes in the lower levels. An end was finally achieved with the collapse of several strategic tunnels by Dwarf Engineers, allowing the city guard to better watch the entrances to the city. A permanent garrison of warriors, the Deepwatch, are employed to regularly patrol the tunnels and to root out any sign of Skaven. As a result, Tobaro is probably the only city in the Old World without a significant population of rats—bipedal or otherwise."

The city authorities paint service in the Deepwatch as glamorous, a life of heroics and adventure in the tunnels beneath the city.\n\nIn truth it is anything but—service in the Deepwatch is distinctly unglamorous, with long days spent in the dark, damp, and cramped conditions.\n\nThe Deepwatch is made up of those too caught-up in the tales of adventure and glory to pay heed to the inherent dangers, or those too desperate to care. The Deepwatch are in essence a guild of professional adventurers, with groups dispatched into the tunnels beneath the city to keep them clear from monsters and stop any creatures from reaching the city. It’s a dangerous job, all right, but somebody has to do it."

Though none of the townsfolk have seen them, hundreds of Crypt Ghouls haunt the catacombs of the citadel. By secret ways they move into and out of the castle to act as the court of the Black Prince, bringing news of the wider world and dispatched on errands of their dark lord. The wolves that prowl the realm of Gashnag answer his call too.

His father is a wealthy and influential merchant, who controls the traffic over five bridges, including the Great Drawbridge over the Reik. As per tradition in Nuln, wealthy families send their eldest sons to the Officer Academy of the great Gunnery School. Bernhardt spent four years learning and gained a reputation as a gifted but troublesome student, graduating at the top of every class he bothered to attend. He was attracted to the glamour of the Cavalry and was known to outride the Reikguard Knights who visited at times. However, he was eventually expelled from the academy for gross insubordination, duelling, and misappropriation of college funds. Bernhardt attempted to join the Knightly orders, but all refused him due to his checkered history. He was even denied a place in the Empire Pistoliers. Despite this setback, Bernhardt now leads the famed mercenary army, the Grudgebringers, named after the magical sword wielded by Bernhardt himself. This mighty blade was forged by the Dwarfs and inscribed with magic runes by a Bright Wizard. The sword was gifted to a young Bernhardt in a supposed chance meeting at the alehouse, the Kippered Herring. An ageing Arch Wizard, Darius Redhand III of the Bright College in Altdorf, saw potential in this upstart and knowing his sword's unquenchable thirst for battle bequeathed it to Morgan."

The oracles and portents all tell of much worse to come, of an impending time of death and destruction unrivalled in the history of the world.\nThe leader of the infamous Grudgebringers, is unwittingly drawn into this insidious plot. Now Bernhardt’s mercenary army must halt the unstoppable tide of evil that assaults the Empire before all is lost.

As such, Dwarf Engineers and Powder Masters have developed a number of substances that, although harmless if ingested by Dawi, are fast-acting and very effective when introduced to Skaven bloodstreams.

On top of the temple stands the iron statue of Hashut. Its hollow iron belly contains a furnace heated by coals so that the statue glows red hot and anyone who touches its surface suffers searing wounds.\n\nThe god is the embodiment of the city, its deity and its master, whose power flows through the Chaos Dwarf Sorcerers, and for whom thousands of slaves are sacrificed by fire and furnace."

Every day is a battle for survival with the dread beasts of the mountains; every night a gauntlet of drum-driven king-sacrifice and death duelling. The Shades' hardiness makes them valued additions to any raiding fleet, and many Dreadlords expend much wealth in enticing them to their cause. When the army attacks, the Shades infiltrate the enemy battleline.

They will then train with a sword and longbow until his or her expertise far exceeds the ability of an average human soldier.

And not just any wine either - the wondrous nectar the Asrai produce is among the finest, if not the finest, anywhere in the Old World. Not that many outsiders have had the privilege, of course; as you might expect, as in other matters the Elves are snobbish and aloof, dismissing the attempts of other races as pathetic, borderline-undrinkable imitations of the real thing and rarely allow anyone from beyond the glades to try it."

As such, Dwarf Engineers and Powder Masters have developed a number of substances that, although harmless if ingested by Dawi, are fast-acting and very effective when introduced to Skaven bloodstreams.

 H11_idea_3_desc:0 "Ellyrian Reavers form a deadly part of Ulthuan's armies. They rove the wild lands of Ellyrion, slaying the monstrous beasts that leave the borders of the Annulii and seek to rampage through the Inner Kingdoms. Many a Cockatrice or Chimera has been laid low by the well-placed arrows or spear thrusts of the noble youths, and many more Dark Elves had had their cruel raids cut short. Indeed, such pride do the Ellyrian Reavers take in their kills that many of the young nobles keep a tally of slain foes. When the sun sets and the fighting ceases, he whose spear has felled the greatest number of enemies is granted the honour of carrying the regiment's standard into the next battle. However, whoever slays the mightiest opponent receives Kurnous' favour; when next he rides to war he will do so as one of Kurnous' Harbingers, blessed with peerless aim by the wild god of the hunt."

They watch the world with malevolent eyes, knowing it is their birthright to rule and the destiny of all others to serve, if they are permitted to live at all. Yet the Malekith knows that his children cannot claim their glorious inheritance while the hated betrayers the High Elves endure. Two halves of a race sundered long ago, separated by the greatest betrayal ever to occur in all the ages of the world, when the soft and weak Asur cast out those who had loyally fought to defend their homeland. Even should every other land bow to their rule, the Naggarothi will not rest until they have brought ruin to the traitors of Ulthuan, toppled their temples, and driven them into the sea. \n\nOn that day the Witch King of Naggaroth, will finally claim a throne long denied him, and the rule of the Dark Elves will spread to every corner of the world."

While Ulthuan’s nobility and bureaucrats across the island may speak of tradition and honor, it is in Avelorn that these ideals are lived with a quiet, unshakable authenticity. Nestled in the shadow of the Annulii mountains, this enchanted realm is a sanctuary of beauty and peace, where nature and magic intertwine in perfect harmony. The forest of Avelorn is a haven of life, home to species long extinct elsewhere, and is alive with wonders found only in legend: majestic unicorns grazing in moonlit glades, delicate fairies flitting among ancient boughs, and vibrant blooms that never wither.\n\nThe Everqueen’s court, ever-moving, is a symphony of creativity and joy. Her people are poets, artists, and mages, each striving to craft beauty worthy of her gaze. Festivals of song and dance are a daily occurrence, their melodies filling the air like whispers of the divine. Elves dine beneath canopies of golden leaves, their conversations interwoven with laughter and the recitation of verses, while actors perform tales of ancient heroism to inspire and delight. It is a land where life is celebrated in all its forms, and every moment is cherished.\n\nTo set foot in Avelorn is to glimpse a fragment of paradise, a place that embodies the very essence of hope and renewal. It is a realm where art and life are inseparable, where the cycle of seasons bows to the will of its Everqueen, and where, against all odds, the promise of a better world endures."

Her role transcends politics, serving as a beacon of hope and a protector of her people against the encroaching darkness.\n\nAs ruler of Avelorn, the Everqueen shares a magical bond with the land, feeling its life as her own. Under her guidance, Avelorn flourishes as a paradise of beauty and wonder, a sanctuary where life and magic intertwine.

Chosen for their unparalleled skill and unyielding spirit, these warrior-maidens guard the sanctity of the sacred and ensure that corruption is met with cleansing flame. Their arrows blaze with enchanted fire, piercing tainted flesh and daemonic forms alike, while their blades strike true against those who defile Avelorn's sanctity.

Her purity and connection to Isha grant her an innate resistance to the dark forces that threaten her people. Most notably, her presence is anathema to tainted creatures, with even the most foul beasts of Chaos faltering in her wake.

The huge stone warrior is depicted leaning on the great sword Sunfang, around which flames seem to writhe. He gazes outward, the line of his vision passing far over the heads of passing viewers as if he were looking into the distance and seeing things further and higher than any mere mortal might view. It is said that this statue was made from drawings and paintings saved from before his fall. Those who knew him say it was accurate. Even Morathi remarked it was a likeness to the life, or so the historian Aergeon claims. When he came to Lothern at the age of sixteen, Teclis noted how the statue's brow was furrowed in thought, and there was a haunted look about his eyes that the sculptors had somehow caught. He did not look merely bold or complacently self-confident or simply brave. He looked lonely and a little lost and burdened by the weight of an awesome responsibility."

Merchants from as far away as Cathay can be found here, trading in goods the High Elves do not have easy access to such as gold, silver, gems, and Dwarf-made clockworks (the Dawi refuse to trade directly with the Elves). They sell tobacco, ores, wool, bring preserved meats and grains and books of lore. Asur from the old kingdoms of Ulthuan would scoff at ever needing something from outsiders. Not so the Elves of Lothern.\nThe architecture of the quarter had taken on a Humanish look. Brick buildings leaned at crazy angles against the remnants of much older elven structures. Ancient palaces had been turned into vast warrens and mazes of dwellings and shops and merchants offices. Carpets hung overhead, draped over wooden racks intended to display them to best advantage. Perhaps it would have worked as intended if the skylights had not been blackened with soot and grime and the shadowy interiors of the corridors lit only by lanterns and flambeaux.\nMerchants argue prices. Harlots lead drunken sailors into side alleys and in pairs they hump and groan against the walls. In quiet corners, men play chess on odd-looking boards with carved wooden pieces of strange design. Despite Dwarfs not directly trading, Imperial Dwarfs can be found here in addition to their Human counterparts\nAt night, the Foreigner's Quarter is ablaze with light. Naked flames burn. Torchbearers walk through darkened alleys. Thousands of people go about their business in the flickering shadows."

Their heraldry is a white ship against a green background.\nIn addition to holdings, House Emeraldsea owns thirty or so ships, among them the Eagle of Lothern, an elven clipper helmed by Captain Joyelle. The Noble House has been known to use these vessels in trade and exploration, as well as raiding the coast of Naggaroth. Few Noble Houses in Lothern equal Emeraldsea's ship number, with only Phoenix King Finubar´s House exceeding it. Both, however, are as ancient as Caledor the Conqueror."

Despite this they are among the most loyal subjects of the Phoenix King and the tales of their daring exploits are many. It is an unusual Elf indeed who has not heard of their valour.

The power of a cannon or a steam tank is nothing beside the power of High magic. If the very laws of nature are at your command, what need have you for hand-made weapons?"\n—Anurion the Green.\n\nAnurion the Green is a High Elf Archmage and noble of Saphery.

 H10_idea_2_desc:0 "The Loremasters of Hoeth are the powerful High Elven battle-mages trained in the White Tower of Hoeth. The Loremasters are invariably gifted warriors, for their intellects find even the exacting physical disciplines of the Swordmasters of Hoeth almost childishly easy to master. Similarly, each Loremaster has a faultless grasp of the principles of magical lore."
 H10_idea_3:0 "The White Tower of Hoeth"
 H10_idea_3_desc:0 ""A thousand years in the building, a millennium of work by hundreds of the greatest mages of the elf people. Webs of geomantic power spun within webs of geomantic power, monstrously powerful spells layered upon monstrously powerful spells, built in a place that was already sacred to the God of Wisdom and a font of awesome power. It is the greatest work of the elves, I think it will most likely endure after we have gone. I sometimes think that it will endure the wreck of the world and that it was intended to do so."\n—Lady Malene on the White Tower\n\nThe White Tower of Hoeth, located on the High Elven island-continent of Ulthuan, is the greatest repository of arcane knowledge in the Known World, compiled down the millennia by the tower's Loremasters -- the greatest High Elf Mages and scholars of Ulthuan, and therefore the world -- who have dedicated their lives to the pursuit and documentation of knowledge, wisdom, and truth.Indeed, the White Tower is not just a tremendous feat of High Elven architecture, but also the centre of learning for the entire island-continent."

Each has studied warfare and personal combat for decades, or even centuries, attaining a martial mastery impossible for shorter-lived races like Men to achieve.\nEach Swordmaster has their own particular style with a blade and each warrior bares an element of their heart when they fight, an aspect of their personality that is so unique and distinct as to be unmistakable to another practitioner of the art."

 H10_idea_6_desc:0 ""Our people are a magical race, the flow of power is strong within our blood. Many of us show some talent in the subtle art of sorcery, though only the most gifted young Asur are given the privilege of being taught the art within the Tower of Hoeth. We have practised our magic for untold millennia, long before the coining of Man, and have developed our sorcery into a form far more refined than, the crude fumblings of the lesser races. The power of our mages is harnessed to protect our isle of Ulthuan, keeping it from sinking beneath the waves and holding at bay the dread powers of Chaos."\n—Recounted by Unthwe Windrider, Herald of the Phoenix King\n\nWhile all elves are a magical race, none amongst Ulthuan´s Kingdoms are more famous than the Archmages from Saphery. An archmage is as much as a warrior as a learned artificer or exceptional advisors. However even in these more traditional roles the Archmages never shrink from the duty to defend Ulthuan. Indeed it is common to see Archmages leading Ulthuan´s Armies, especially when what assails the Island Continent is of magical nature, such as the supernatural threats hailing from the Realm of Chaos.\nAnd even when not their presence on the battlefield can turn an inevitable defeat into a spectacular victory. The Battle of Finuval Plain is such a grand example, where the relatively young Arch Mages Teclis hurled the Witch King to what seemed for many years, his grave, saving Ulthuan´s from falling to Druchi´s hands at what is perhaps the greatest battle for the Asur´s survival since the days of Aenerion the defender."

 H10_idea_7_desc:0 "The Library is a vast, strange place, much like the White Tower itself. There are sections that some people never see and yet others can visit every day. Sometimes, a mage will find a chamber full of books just once in his life and never be able to find the way back. The Library is part of the Tower and the Tower has a mind, of sorts, of its own.\nAs the greatest repository of knowledge that the Asur have ever created, it is believed to surpass even the fabled Library of Caledor back in the dawn of the world. Hundreds of the greatest sorcerers from all across the continent come here to consult the Library; talk with colleagues and share their knowledge with the students.\nBoth the Library's shelves and corridors fill the entire bottom of the Tower, as well as the huge labyrinth of tunnels and cellars beneath it.\nEven more impressive is the complex labyrinth of spells that make the experience of studying in the Library different for every person who visits it. For one mage, there will be shelves that they have seen that haven't been visited since the Library was first built. Other mages, meanwhile, may find their way to parts of the Library that not even Teclis would ever find. It was as if some guardian spirit presided over the place, and gave to each student what they required.\nThe Library of the White Tower contains a number of maps showcasing even the layout of Slann Temple-cities."

Instead, entire generations - or 'brothers of the same water' - simply emerge, fully formed from spawning pools in the jungles or in the dank caverns beneath each temple-city, even those otherwise ruined.\n\nThese pools have existed since the age of the Old Ones, and contain a weirdly glowing, magical, primordial soup. Many spawnings are predicted in Sacred Plaques, while others occur without warning, and are always treated as holy portents of great significance.\n\nSpawning pools are amongst the most sacred of places to the Lizardmen, and the loss of even one is a great tragedy."

Shortly after captured by wolfrider goblins in a turn of ill fate, this setback was to be the founding-stone of his legend, impressing the caravan slavemaster so much with the great variety of insults he hurled at his dwarven near-inmates in perfect Khazalid, soon  their leader was stooped over dead, and Runtgit returned to the Eight-Peaks at the head of the Wolf Riders."

Everywhere, hordes of laughing goblins descended on the newly conquered Skaven territories, hacking furred bodies to pieces in vicious tunnel fights. In every corner of the upper city, the Skaven were ambushed and destroyed. Skarsnik’s genius had been to assault the Skaven outposts simultaneously. Isolated, unable to reinforce each other or bring their numbers to bear, the Skaven armies panicked, and were cut down by the hundreds.  - Skarsnik recovering Karak 8 peaks from Skaven."

Once a drought of this deadly brew is consumed by a Night Goblin, the first indication of the brew taking effect is when the creature's eyes begin to bulge and his whole body has an uncontrollable urge to begin spinning. When used against the enemy, the Night Goblin Fanatic is held down by his mates until an enemy unit approaches close enough for them to launch their attack. At this time, the mob hands the fanatic the end of a massive chain and chucks him in the direction of the enemy. Free at last, the deranged Night Goblin would spin crazily."

However, his father originally wanted him to be a famous professor at the University of Altdorf, but Bickenstadt refused to follow the path his father laid out for him. This choice had since changed Bickenstadt's life forever, for after refusing his wishes and breaking his father's once-kind heart, Bickenstad went about his life as a freelance playwright, where he would eventually journey to the hostile lands of the Border Princes.
