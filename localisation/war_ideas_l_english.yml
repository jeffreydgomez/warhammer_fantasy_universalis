The Dark Apostle must entreat the Ruinous Powers and bind that denizen to his ferocious will, thus dragging it through the portal the Sorcerer has created. The Warpsmith's role is to provide the mechanical shell into which the daemon is bound, and to set the warding-chains upon it so that the daemon does not escape.\n\nIn some cases, those who seek to create the Daemon Engine are dragged through the portal they have created and cast adrift upon the tides of the Warp, their bodies torn apart in seconds by the predators of that unreal dimension, their souls fed upon for all eternity.

 A03_idea_2:0 "Hochlander Tolerance"
 A03_idea_2_desc:0 "Hochland is pretty diverse in the gods worshipped, as Taal and Rhya are obviously both very popular due to the forests covering the province, but a significant following of Ulric and Sigmar can also be found throughout the province.

 A03_idea_3:0 "Hardy Woodsmen"
 A03_idea_3_desc:0 "Hochlands armies differ from most of the empire's armies found in other provinces like Reikland and Ostland, since its military is primarily suited for small skirmishes and forest fighting, rather than the large open battles that would take place elsewhere in the Empire."

The logs are then bought by brokers, loaded on barges, and shipped out. "
 A03_idea_6:0 "T  he Kind Men of Hochland"
 A03_idea_6_desc:0 "Hochlanders are pretty friendly, as their province is heavily traveled by people crossing or visiting so are a pretty nice bunch of people to be around, though other provinces have suggested that this if from open-eyed naivete because Sigmar forbid someone in the Empire is just nice to other people."

 A07_idea_5:0 "Eaters of Anything"
 A07_idea_5_desc:0 "Notoriously thrifty, Ostlanders are known for their ability to survive. Said to be capable of eating anything, there are several mocking songs about the famous ‘Stone soup of Ostland’ They are so creative in their frugality that a common joke in the Empire claims that Ostlanders make ‘stone soup’ with only one stone, for fear of wasting good rocks."
 A07_idea_6:0 "A Bastion of Sigmar"
 A07_idea_6_desc:0 "Ostlanders, like most Imperials, honour all the gods and celebrate their feast days. If one god is favoured over another, however, it is Sigmar, who is worshipped with a degree of devotion not often seen in the east of the Empire. Surrounded by lands that lean toward Ulric and Taal and Rhya, few know why this is so, though many offer explanations. Devout Ostlanders say it stems from the time when, soon after the founding of the Empire, a great dragon ravaged Ostland. The other electors and their armies were afraid to face the beast, so Sigmar came alone and killed it after a great fight alongside the Ostland Count. On the other hand, cynics suggest that Ostlanders are so devoted because their “poor cousin” Electors have to keep borrowing money from wealthy Reiklanders and thus need to keep them happy. Whatever the truth, it is a fact that even the smallest Ostlander village sports multiple shrines to Sigmar"

The Stir is both a well-travelled trade route and the entire northern border of Stirland.

 A08_idea_5:0 "Talabeclander Fury"
 A08_idea_5_desc:0 "At their best, Talabeclanders are patient woodsfolk, with a quiet intensity and honour. Talabeclanders, even their nobility, are unusually self-effacing for an Imperial people.

 A09_idea_1_desc:0 "Once a mighty city that could rival many others within the Empire, Mordheim grew decadent with corruption, and as these multitudes gathered for the arrival of the Twin-Tailed Comet, it is said that Sigmar judged them false and smited the city, killing all those left within.\n\nNow, it is a dead city, where only the foolish, mad or greedy seek to venture forth, either to plunder the riches of the ruins or to covet the green shards of comet-borne Warpstone that lace the entire city with its corruption.\n\nWhile, in 2302 IC, Emperor Magnus the Pious led a mighty Imperial army to the city and burnt its cursed ruins to the ground after his victory over the forces of Chaos, Ostermark still has plenty of Mercenary contacts in the West"

 A09_idea_2_desc:0 "Ostermark is like a miniature of the Empire, a league of free and independent towns relying on each other for mutual security. We have to—no one else in the Empire cares a fig about us.\n\n —Chancellor Wolfram Hertwig, Elector Count of Ostermark"
 A09_idea_3:0 "Mixture of people"
 A09_idea_3_desc:0 "At the formation of the Empire Adelhard, leader of the Ostagoths, and his warriors took wives and mistresses from among the people of Averland, Stirland, and Talabecland upon their march home. These women were the first of many new bloodlines to come into the region, now named Ostermark.\n\nTo this mixture were added Ungol elements during the invasions of the mid-18th century IC, bringing a horse-raising culture to Ostermark's Veldt region. Kislevites would cross the border, too, though more as settlers than conquerors, fleeing the cruelties of their tsar or natural disasters such as famine or drought. All these elements blended to form a people who, while still recognisably Imperial in culture and language, showed distinct differences from their more western cousins."
 A09_idea_4:0 "The Death's Head"
 A09_idea_4_desc:0 "The halberdiers known as the Death's Heads were founded during the Vampire Wars. They began in the town of Essen, Ostermark during the rule of Vlad von Carstein. Those who dared to speak up against Vlad, let alone partake in armed resistance, soon disappeared, so in order to protect their identities, the first Death's Heads wore skulls as masks.\n\nThe Death's Heads became famous after freeing Essen during a rebellion. Later, they took part in the Battle of Hel Fenn. Today the Death's Heads recruit not only from Essen, but all over Ostermark."

 A09_idea_7:0 "Hertwig's Folly"
 A09_idea_7_desc:0 "In the year 2485 at the Battle of Black Road Wolfram Hertwig, Elector Count of the Ostermark, stubbornly refused to allow the Grand Master of the Knights of the Everlasting Light to take command of his army, though Hertwig was barely into his teens and had never commanded an army in battle. In response, Grand Master Kessler and his warriors rode back to their chapter house leaving Hertwig's army to fight the invading Orcs without their aid. \n\nThough the greenskins were eventually defeated, the count's army suffered horrific losses and for many years, the Ostermark was dependant on aid from the armies of Ostland or Talabecland for its survival. Needless to say, Hertwig's Folly (as it has now become known) stands as a cautionary tale to those who would allow ego to blind them to the value of having the greatest warriors of the Empire fighting alongside them."

A Tilean condottiero like many others, Colombo is also an accomplished marksman, navigator, explorer, adventurer, commander, merchant, diplomat and the most fashionable in Lustria; at least, according to his biographers. Be as it may, his skills led him to become a famed general, the Prince of Trantio in Tilea, and one of the few beings in existence with a usable line of contacts with the Slanns of Lustria, or at least their Skink chiefs, a line that goes all the way up to Lord Mazdamundi himself nevertheless.\n\nNot unlike when treating with Dwarfs, a single faux pas can lead to not only economic collapse of a valuable trade line, but also utter destruction. Colombo is well-aware of the fact, and handles his contacts personally and carefully. In exchange for exorbitantly valuable items, Colombo leads his forces against any such marauding foe that the lethargic Lizardmen don't have the initiative to handle directly, such as Dark Elves or other pirates. With that in mind, Colombo also has little patience for other humans who constantly put his privileged trade partnership at risk with their callous greed, as opposed to his own well-managed fine taste."

 A55_idea_1_desc:0 "Although unassailable from outside, Tobaro was not so secure from within and its extensive and uncharted network of tunnels proved to be its bane. Skaven forces attacked the city from below in a series of raids between IC 1563 and 1565, razing large parts of the city and enslaving much of the populace.\n\nThe Prince of Tobaro, Meldo Marcelli, managed to escape with many of his soldiers and most of his ships. Arriving in Remas he spent all his wealth hiring a great army of mercenaries, including a strong contingent from Remas. Returning without delay, and reinforced by a contingent of Sea Elves, the force succeeded in entering the harbour unnoticed and sneaking into the city, catching the Skaven unawares and driving them back, driving them back into the catacombs. There followed further bitter fighting within the rock of the acropolis before all the Skaven were finally cleared.\n\nFighting between the Tobarans and the Ratmen continued on and off for many years with countless skirmishes in the lower levels. An end was finally achieved with the collapse of several strategic tunnels by Dwarf Engineers, allowing the city guard to better watch the entrances to the city. A permanent garrison of warriors, the Deepwatch, are employed to regularly patrol the tunnels and to root out any sign of Skaven. As a result, Tobaro is probably the only city in the Old World without a significant population of rats—bipedal or otherwise."

The city authorities paint service in the Deepwatch as glamorous, a life of heroics and adventure in the tunnels beneath the city.\n\nIn truth it is anything but—service in the Deepwatch is distinctly unglamorous, with long days spent in the dark, damp, and cramped conditions.\n\nThe Deepwatch is made up of those too caught-up in the tales of adventure and glory to pay heed to the inherent dangers, or those too desperate to care. The Deepwatch are in essence a guild of professional adventurers, with groups dispatched into the tunnels beneath the city to keep them clear from monsters and stop any creatures from reaching the city. It’s a dangerous job, all right, but somebody has to do it."

His father is a wealthy and influential merchant, who controls the traffic over five bridges, including the Great Drawbridge over the Reik. As per tradition in Nuln, wealthy families send their eldest sons to the Officer Academy of the great Gunnery School. Bernhardt spent four years learning and gained a reputation as a gifted but troublesome student, graduating at the top of every class he bothered to attend. He was attracted to the glamour of the Cavalry and was known to outride the Reikguard Knights who visited at times. However, he was eventually expelled from the academy for gross insubordination, duelling, and misappropriation of college funds. Bernhardt attempted to join the Knightly orders, but all refused him due to his checkered history. He was even denied a place in the Empire Pistoliers. Despite this setback, Bernhardt now leads the famed mercenary army, the Grudgebringers, named after the magical sword wielded by Bernhardt himself. This mighty blade was forged by the Dwarfs and inscribed with magic runes by a Bright Wizard. The sword was gifted to a young Bernhardt in a supposed chance meeting at the alehouse, the Kippered Herring. An ageing Arch Wizard, Darius Redhand III of the Bright College in Altdorf, saw potential in this upstart and knowing his sword's unquenchable thirst for battle bequeathed it to Morgan."

The oracles and portents all tell of much worse to come, of an impending time of death and destruction unrivalled in the history of the world.\nThe leader of the infamous Grudgebringers, is unwittingly drawn into this insidious plot. Now Bernhardt’s mercenary army must halt the unstoppable tide of evil that assaults the Empire before all is lost. Rivers of blood will surely flow before the flood is finally stemmed, but try they must, for every sword has a part to play in the titanic struggle to destroy the servants of the Horned Rat."

As such, Dwarf Engineers and Powder Masters have developed a number of substances that, although harmless if ingested by Dawi, are fast-acting and very effective when introduced to Skaven bloodstreams. The method of delivery varies between lobbing canisters of the stuff at enemy lines to carefully lacing water supplies and known feeding spots where ravenous Skaven feeling the Black Hunger gather; the results speak for themselves… "

The weapons of war and magics of the Skytitans slew most of the Ogre race in what came to be known as the War in the Sky, but in the end the dwindled Ogres still outnumbered the Skytitans hundreds to one and the isolated, singular lifestyle of the Skytitans prevented them from uniting, resulting in each Skytitan being besieged and eaten (often alive) in his own home by packs of vermin-like Ogres."

And not just any wine either - the wondrous nectar the Asrai produce is among the finest, if not the finest, anywhere in the Old World. Not that many outsiders have had the privilege, of course; as you might expect, as in other matters the Elves are snobbish and aloof, dismissing the attempts of other races as pathetic, borderline-undrinkable imitations of the real thing and rarely allow anyone from beyond the glades to try it."
 woodelf_idea_7:0 "Coined-Based Trade"
 woodelf_idea_7_desc:0 "Most of the Asrai do not utilise any traditional form of currency, as is the custom throughout the Old World. Money is regarded by the Wood Elves as one of the misguided old inventions of Ulthuan. However, some Hinterglades situated in close proximity to human settlements do adopt metal currency after guides or trackers who work for humans have introduced it. dolescents from suburban Hinterglades are even capable of engaging in human commerce by mimicking human behaviour and values. Wood Elves who choose to live amongst humans often copy their styles of dress."

As such, Dwarf Engineers and Powder Masters have developed a number of substances that, although harmless if ingested by Dawi, are fast-acting and very effective when introduced to Skaven bloodstreams. The method of delivery varies between lobbing canisters of the stuff at enemy lines to carefully lacing water supplies and known feeding spots where ravenous Skaven feeling the Black Hunger gather; the results speak for themselves… "

Elves dine beneath canopies of golden leaves, their conversations interwoven with laughter and the recitation of verses, while actors perform tales of ancient heroism to inspire and delight. It is a land where life is celebrated in all its forms, and every moment is cherished.\n\nTo set foot in Avelorn is to glimpse a fragment of paradise, a place that embodies the very essence of hope and renewal.

At her coronation, she inherits the collective wisdom and power of every woman in her maternal line who has held the title, granting her unmatched mastery over the magic of Life and Light. Her role transcends politics, serving as a beacon of hope and a protector of her people against the encroaching darkness.\n\nAs ruler of Avelorn, the Everqueen shares a magical bond with the land, feeling its life as her own. Under her guidance, Avelorn flourishes as a paradise of beauty and wonder, a sanctuary where life and magic intertwine.

Chosen for their unparalleled skill and unyielding spirit, these warrior-maidens guard the sanctity of the sacred and ensure that corruption is met with cleansing flame. Their arrows blaze with enchanted fire, piercing tainted flesh and daemonic forms alike, while their blades strike true against those who defile Avelorn's sanctity.

Her symbol, the "All Seeing Eye," weeps for the sorrows of her mortal children, a reminder of her unending love and care. It is Isha who blesses the Everqueen with wisdom, beauty and power, and she also who preserves the eternal glades of Avelorn from the blemish of winter."

As the Everqueen, Alarielle embodies the very essence of nature itself—wherever she walks, the earth blooms in her wake, fields of green springing forth and flowers unfurling in her presence.\n\nAs a servant of light and nature, Alarielle stands as a fierce opponent of corruption in all its forms. Her purity and connection to Isha grant her an innate resistance to the dark forces that threaten her people. Most notably, her presence is anathema to tainted creatures, with even the most foul beasts of Chaos faltering in her wake.

The huge stone warrior is depicted leaning on the great sword Sunfang, around which flames seem to writhe. He gazes outward, the line of his vision passing far over the heads of passing viewers as if he were looking into the distance and seeing things further and higher than any mere mortal might view. It is said that this statue was made from drawings and paintings saved from before his fall. Those who knew him say it was accurate. Even Morathi remarked it was a likeness to the life, or so the historian Aergeon claims. When he came to Lothern at the age of sixteen, Teclis noted how the statue's brow was furrowed in thought, and there was a haunted look about his eyes that the sculptors had somehow caught.

Merchants from as far away as Cathay can be found here, trading in goods the High Elves do not have easy access to such as gold, silver, gems, and Dwarf-made clockworks (the Dawi refuse to trade directly with the Elves). They sell tobacco, ores, wool, bring preserved meats and grains and books of lore. Asur from the old kingdoms of Ulthuan would scoff at ever needing something from outsiders. Not so the Elves of Lothern.\nThe architecture of the quarter had taken on a Humanish look. Brick buildings leaned at crazy angles against the remnants of much older elven structures. Ancient palaces had been turned into vast warrens and mazes of dwellings and shops and merchants offices. Carpets hung overhead, draped over wooden racks intended to display them to best advantage. Perhaps it would have worked as intended if the skylights had not been blackened with soot and grime and the shadowy interiors of the corridors lit only by lanterns and flambeaux.\nMerchants argue prices. Harlots lead drunken sailors into side alleys and in pairs they hump and groan against the walls. In quiet corners, men play chess on odd-looking boards with carved wooden pieces of strange design. Despite Dwarfs not directly trading, Imperial Dwarfs can be found here in addition to their Human counterparts\nAt night, the Foreigner's Quarter is ablaze with light. Naked flames burn. Torchbearers walk through darkened alleys. Thousands of people go about their business in the flickering shadows."

The Noble House has been known to use these vessels in trade and exploration, as well as raiding the coast of Naggaroth.

The power of our mages is harnessed to protect our isle of Ulthuan, keeping it from sinking beneath the waves and holding at bay the dread powers of Chaos."\n—Recounted by Unthwe Windrider, Herald of the Phoenix King\n\nWhile all elves are a magical race, none amongst Ulthuan´s Kingdoms are more famous than the Archmages from Saphery. An archmage is as much as a warrior as a learned artificer or exceptional advisors. However even in these more traditional roles the Archmages never shrink from the duty to defend Ulthuan. Indeed it is common to see Archmages leading Ulthuan´s Armies, especially when what assails the Island Continent is of magical nature, such as the supernatural threats hailing from the Realm of Chaos.\nAnd even when not their presence on the battlefield can turn an inevitable defeat into a spectacular victory. The Battle of Finuval Plain is such a grand example, where the relatively young Arch Mages Teclis hurled the Witch King to what seemed for many years, his grave, saving Ulthuan´s from falling to Druchi´s hands at what is perhaps the greatest battle for the Asur´s survival since the days of Aenerion the defender."
 H10_idea_7:0 "Great Library"
 H10_idea_7_desc:0 "The Library is a vast, strange place, much like the White Tower itself. There are sections that some people never see and yet others can visit every day. Sometimes, a mage will find a chamber full of books just once in his life and never be able to find the way back. The Library is part of the Tower and the Tower has a mind, of sorts, of its own.\nAs the greatest repository of knowledge that the Asur have ever created, it is believed to surpass even the fabled Library of Caledor back in the dawn of the world. Hundreds of the greatest sorcerers from all across the continent come here to consult the Library; talk with colleagues and share their knowledge with the students.\nBoth the Library's shelves and corridors fill the entire bottom of the Tower, as well as the huge labyrinth of tunnels and cellars beneath it.\nEven more impressive is the complex labyrinth of spells that make the experience of studying in the Library different for every person who visits it. For one mage, there will be shelves that they have seen that haven't been visited since the Library was first built. Other mages, meanwhile, may find their way to parts of the Library that not even Teclis would ever find. It was as if some guardian spirit presided over the place, and gave to each student what they required.\nThe Library of the White Tower contains a number of maps showcasing even the layout of Slann Temple-cities."

 Z93_ideas_1_desc:0 "Before Elves, before Dwarfs, before Men, the Old Ones arrived upon this world. Then came Chaos and the Great Plan of the Old Ones was unmade. We are the last of their servants, and only by our hand shall the Great Plan be restored, with the total defeat of the usurping younger races.\n\n—Inscription upon the eastern boundary stone of the temple-city of Hexoatl."
 Z93_ideas_2:0 "Spawning Pools"
 Z93_ideas_2_desc:0 "Lizardmen do not reproduce, give birth or parent young in any conventional sense. Instead, entire generations - or 'brothers of the same water' - simply emerge, fully formed from spawning pools in the jungles or in the dank caverns beneath each temple-city, even those otherwise ruined.\n\nThese pools have existed since the age of the Old Ones, and contain a weirdly glowing, magical, primordial soup. Many spawnings are predicted in Sacred Plaques, while others occur without warning, and are always treated as holy portents of great significance.\n\nSpawning pools are amongst the most sacred of places to the Lizardmen, and the loss of even one is a great tragedy."
 Z93_ideas_3:0 "Jungle Homelands"
 Z93_ideas_3_desc:0 "Only the Lizardmen and other cold-blooded creatures can endure the stifling heat and humidity for long; other races eventually sicken and die. To its native Lizardmen, however, Lustria is a haven -- a deathtrap to invaders and a bulwark against the disorder set loose in the world with the coming of Chaos."

 Z93_ideas_6_desc:0 "While some believe the Lizardmen are a fading people, using the ruined temple-cities as evidence, let us stand in defiance of this notion. Let us refound the ancient temple-cities that have stood runed and nigh-empty for millennia. The jungle will quake as Stegadon and Bastiladon bring stone quarried from the mountains of the Spine of Sotek, while countless Kroxigor work to raise the cities up to their former glory. The jungle will resonate to the sound of Skink artisans carving intricate stone reliefs. The ground trembles as huge stone blocks, borne upon the backs of Kroxigors, are dropped into place with incongruous precision."

 V05_idea_1_desc:0 "Sacred relics torn from the walls and altars of the lizardfolk can be sold for a fortune in cities from Marienburg to Wei-Jin.

 V05_idea_2:0 "Skeggi Must Survive"
 V05_idea_2_desc:0 "Skeggi survives. Nobody really knows how, but it is what Skeggi is good at doing. It is not a wealthy city or a safe city or a kind city. It is not even a sane city. But it is a persistent city. And in the savage world of Lustria, that is worth a fortune."
 V05_idea_3:0 "Norsemen of Lustria"
 V05_idea_3_desc:0 "Explorers from the Old World have men and steel, but Skegglings know they need proper spiked boots for the jungle swamps, cooler clothes for the hot climate and food supplies that will endure the moisture, machetes, mosquito nets, antivenom kits, climbing harnesses, pick axes, maps, compasses, waterskins, rope, iron spikes and a hammer and knapsacks to keep it all in."
 V05_idea_4:0 "The Deathkeepers"
 V05_idea_4_desc:0  "In response to Luthor Harkon's mad ambitions, Skeggi hastily assembled a navy to guard against seaborne attacks. This collection of Marauders calls themselves the Dodvakt or Deathkeepers. In the centuries to come the Dodvakt would fend off the undead and would later stop Estalia and Tilea from taking the settlement by force. When there are no foes to fight they act as Skeggi's fishing guild."
 V05_idea_5:0 "The Ever-Sinking City"
 V05_idea_5_desc:0 "Skeggi is built on shifting sand and soft loam, and all the original buildings were slowly sucked under the surface or washed away. The wood the Norsemen use to build their longhouses buckle and rot in the Lustiran climate. The result is that not only is every house built on stilts but it is often also built on the remnants of the house built below it. This has created a hierarchy where the higher your house stands above the ground, the higher your standing in society is."

 Z07_idea_3:0 "Respected in Life and Death"  
 Z07_idea_3_desc:0 "Despite her gender, Khalida was highly respected across all the lands of Nehekhara and adored by her subjects. Her intelligence, temper, and bravery were as legendary as her beauty, as was her intense sense of honor and justice. Her reign was tragically short, cut down in her prime. All of Nehekhara mourned her passing, for they knew she would have brought great glory to the empire."  
 Z07_idea_4:0 "Beloved of Asaph"  
 Z07_idea_4_desc:0 "High Queen Khalida was defeated in battle by her cousin Neferata, the first vampire. Instead of simply letting her die, Neferata gave her the Blood Kiss. Rather than suffering the curse of vampirism, Khalida begged the Serpent Goddess Asaph to save her. The goddess turned her blood to venom, killing her instantly. Upon her resurrection, the High Queen still carried venom in her veins, and her devotion to the goddess became even stronger than in life."  
 Z07_idea_5:0 "City of Serpents"  
 Z07_idea_5_desc:0 "Following Khalida's short reign as Queen of Lybaras and her eventual resurrection by Asaph, the goddess of vengeance, magic, and serpents, the city took this goddess as its personal patron deity. Carvings of the goddess' beloved asps adorn every surface of the city's funeral monuments, and these serpentine engravings constantly writhe across the stonework, hissing at any who walk in their shadow and spying on any who dare explore the streets."

 Z07_idea_7:0 "Purge All Vampires!"

Suffering from both raiding by Black Arks and Sartosa pirates, along with the occasional Araby corsair, the city also suffers from the occasional storm. The harbor must be transformed into a stronghold to resist the barbarians across the sea and the wrath of the gods. The harbor shall be enclosed by walls, and Screaming Skull Catapults positioned along them."

 Z03_idea_3:0 "Karitamen's Return"  
 Z03_idea_3_desc:0 "Karitamen the Death Scarab was an ambitious general and one of Amenemhetum's subordinates. So impressed was the Great King with his general’s accomplishments that he granted him control of his western holdings as a vassal Priest King. With his return, the king now has someone worthy of his ambitions and capable of fulfilling them."  
 Z03_idea_4:0 "Amenemhetum's Ambition"  
 Z03_idea_4_desc:0 "In life, Amenemhetum the Great expanded across the Black Gulf into the land now known as Tilea and into the deserts of Araby. With all the pieces in place, the Tomb King seeks to restore his realm, reclaim his tomb, and crush those damned pirates along the way."  
 Z03_idea_5:0 "Zandri Eternals"  
 Z03_idea_5_desc:0 "These soldiers were the royal bodyguard of King Behedesh II, as they were for his father before him. They bore a magical banner that was a relic of their ancient city – the Standard of the Undying Legion. Within the icon were the warrior spirits of those long fallen, ready to fulfill an undying pledge to aid the great kings of Zandri. Unlike the Tomb Guard of the other cities, the Eternals are trained for marine warfare rather than providing a bulwark for chariots."  
 Z03_idea_6:0 "Learning from the Living"  
 Z03_idea_6_desc:0 "Though Zandri's fleet is impressive, naval engagements with the Black Arks of Naggarond, Sea Patrols of Ulthuan, and navies of the Southern Realms have taught Amenemhetum that the war barges of old can't stand up to modern fleets and must be improved. Larger, stronger hulls and more artillery seem to do the trick."  
 Z03_idea_7:0 "Dominance of the Black Gulf"  
 Z03_idea_7_desc:0 "Zandri has returned to greatness, and with it, control of the inner sea. All trade between Araby and the Old World must go through the Armada of the Dead. Merchants that provide tribute to their betters will be allowed through, while those that don't will drown in the depths."
