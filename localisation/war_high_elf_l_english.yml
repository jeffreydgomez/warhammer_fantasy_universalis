asur_please_nobles_title:0 "Convince the Conclave"
asur_please_nobles_desc:0 "The Great Conclave, convened in Tor Alessi, has condemned our efforts at unification. Prince Carvalhír of Caledor speaks openly of secession.

asur_grow_2_title:0 "Prepare for the Next Conclave"

asur_naggaroth_grow_2_desc:0 "Laethor, the half-Druchii son of a disgraced noble, approaches under truce. He speaks not of war, but of kinship, pleading for a path of reconciliation.

asur_lustria_grow_2_desc:0 "Commander Caledhír sends grim news: our efforts to commune with the lizardmen are met with fang and claw. He proposes a shift—no longer allies, but subjects. Should we abandon the mission's ideals and claim the jungle by force? Or continue to seek the wisdom of the ancients?"

asur_rebuild_title:0 "Restore and Rebuild"

asur_relations_with_druchii_desc:0 "The Druchii are our mirror, cracked and darkened. Yet in the frozen cities of Naggarond, there are those who question the Witch King’s endless war. If even one darkened soul can be turned to the light, then perhaps reconciliation is possible—however slight."

asur_the_sacred_marriage_title:0 "The Sacred Marriage"
asur_the_sacred_marriage_desc:0 "The Marriage of the Phoenix King and the Everqueen was more than tradition—it was the spiritual union of the Asur soul. Its severance deepened our division.

asur_naggaroth_purge_title:0 "Cleanse the Blight"
asur_naggaroth_purge_desc:0 "Enough. The Druchii who refuse unity, who mock our hand of peace, must face judgment. Under banners of flame and song, we march to scour the taint from Naggaroth’s heart. The blood price of unity is steep—but we shall pay it gladly."

asur_lustria_friend_title:0 "Speak to the Old Blood"
asur_lustria_friend_desc:0 "The Lizardmen are cryptic and cold, but they are not our enemy. Our shared hatred of Chaos forges common ground. If we can decipher their signs and survive their jungles, a potent alliance may blossom—strange and wild as the continent itself."

asur_lustria_purge_title:0 "Extirpate the Corruption"
asur_lustria_purge_desc:0 "Despite our efforts, corruption festers in Lustria—some born of Chaos, some born of Asur arrogance. We cannot allow any threat to linger. With ritual fire and silver blades, we shall burn out every nest of evil and restore celestial harmony—on our terms."

## Mission Events

asur_events.200.title:0 "Future of Naggaroth"
asur_events.200.desc:0 "The Black Coast burns with the fires of war, and yet peace lingers on the horizon. Our foothold in Naggaroth—secured through hardship and blood—stands firm. From the ruins of Clar Karond to the shadowed woods near Arnheim, our banners fly beside ancient and hostile towers.\n\nPrince Calrith of Yvresse has called for total conquest, demanding vengeance for ages of Druchii betrayal. Meanwhile, Loremaster Elthryon of the White Tower proposes dialogue, citing omens of a shared divine burden. The Druchii cults may yet be twisted, but their understanding of our gods is not without eerie familiarity.\n\nDo we extend our hand or sharpen our sword? The lords of Lothern are divided. Naggaroth may fall beneath our heel—or rise beside us in a new age of elven unity."
asur_events.200.a:0 "Naggaroth shall be ours!"
asur_events.200.b:0 "Let us understand the Druchii."

asur_events.201.title:0 "Decision in Lustria"
asur_events.201.desc:0 "From the sweltering jungles of Itza to the mist-covered ruins of Tlaxtlan, our emissaries have struggled to find purchase. The Lizardmen remain elusive and enigmatic, shunning diplomacy in favor of inscrutable rituals and sudden ambushes. Temple-City priests chant to ancient gods whose tongues we barely comprehend.\n\nArchmage Thelaen of Eataine believes conquest is inevitable—arguing the lizardfolk respect only strength. In contrast, Lady Amryelle of Saphery urges patience, having glimpsed in geomantic patterns a cosmic design in which our fates intertwine. She speaks of alignment with the Old Ones’ purpose, a truth beyond bloodshed.\n\nThe time to decide has come. Shall we break the walls of Hexoatl and claim the continent, or humble ourselves and seek wisdom in scales and stone?"
asur_events.201.a:0 "Lustria shall be ours!"
asur_events.201.b:0 "Honor the Old Ones and seek unity."

asur_events.202.title:0 "The Old World's Fate"
asur_events.202.desc:0 "We have walked the bloodied fields of Bretonnia and wept beside the burning holds of Kislev. At Altdorf, we saw nobles turn from Sigmar and embrace shadows, even as their people cried out for order. The Old World stands in shambles—corruption at every gate, chaos lurking behind every smile.\n\nGeneral Daerion of Caledor calls for annexation. He believes only direct Asur rule can prevent the complete collapse of these kingdoms. By contrast, Queen's Envoy Irielle of Lothern proposes an alliance of arms and steel, binding the men and dwarfs of the continent into a grand bulwark under our guidance.\n\nDo we crush the dying regimes and rebuild in our image, or stand beside them and lend the fire of our forge to temper their failing will?"
asur_events.202.a:0 "The Old World shall be ours!"
asur_events.202.b:0 "We will stand beside them"

asur_events.203.title:0 "The Southlands Stand"
asur_events.203.desc:0 "The Southlands stir with chaos. The shadow of Nagash looms over the Tomb Kings' ancient crypts, and the beastmen of the Charred Wastes multiply like wildfire. In the ruined city of Lahmia, foul whispers echo once more, and orc warbands surge across the dunes in green tides.\n\nMarshal Relorion of Chrace demands direct control. He sees the Southlands as a rotting limb that must be cut and cauterized. Yet Seeress Vyelari of Saphery believes in a gentler path. She has found allies among the Araby emirs and the silent priests of Nehekhara, who welcome our aid in resisting encroaching madness.\n\nThe time of decision is upon us. Will we impose order with sword and flame, or nurture it through shield and bond?"
asur_events.203.a:0 "The Southlands shall be ours!"
asur_events.203.b:0 "Forge alliances and destroy the enemy together."





### Events

asur_events.0.t:0 "Ulthuan for the Asur"
asur_events.0.d:0 "They came in ships, cruel and fast, and landed on our shores with eyes on conquest. Using foreign speech and worshipping foreign gods, they seek to overrun our lands and subjugate the ancient Asur. Shall we stand united against this peril?"
asur_events.0.a:0 "Asur never shall be slaves!" 
asur_events.0.b:0 "Let us gather a coalition."
asur_events.0.c:0 "The Phoenix King has returned!"


asur_events.2.title:0 "Passing of an Age"
asur_events.2.desc:0 "A heavy gloom hangs over our people as we contemplate the waning influence of the Asur in the wider world. Once, the glories of Ulthuan were unmatched, and the High Elves stood as the true masters of magic and civilization. Now, our rivals grow in strength, and we find ourselves fighting to maintain even a fraction of our former dominance.\n\nThis melancholy weighs heavily on all aspects of our society. The discipline of our armies falters, our philosophers produce fewer insights, and our artisans struggle to create works that truly inspire. Is this the inevitable decline of our race, or shall we find a way to rekindle the fires of our greatness?"
asur_events.2.a:0 "The army seems hardest hit."
asur_events.2.b:0 "Our philosophers just aren't producing."
asur_events.2.c:0 "Look at this shiny new statue!"

asur_events.3.title:0 "Intrigue in the Phoenix Court"
asur_events.3.desc:0 "A sharp-witted diplomat in our service has uncovered a fragment of unusual and dangerous knowledge within the Phoenix Court. It is unclear how they came by this information, but its implications are immense. If used wisely, this secret could tip the scales of influence in our favor—or cause irreparable harm if misused.\n\nThe court is a place of subtlety, and every move carries risk. Do we stoop to blackmail, embarrassing our rivals for personal gain? Or do we take the high road, either using the knowledge to strengthen our alliances or simply choosing not to act at all?"
asur_events.3.a:0 "Blackmail, of course."
asur_events.3.b:0 "Let's not embarrass them."
asur_events.3.c:0 "We are above all this."

asur_events.4.title:0 "Birth of a Mage"
asur_events.4.desc:0 "In [province_name], a child has been born whose magical potential is unlike anything we have seen in generations. Even in their earliest years, they have displayed control over the winds of magic, shaping it as if it were a natural extension of themselves. It is a sign of great promise for the Asur.\n\nSuch a gift must be nurtured carefully. Should we send the child to the White Tower of Hoeth, where they can study under the most learned sages? Or perhaps their talents are best used in our armies, where their power can be honed for the defense of Ulthuan? Alternatively, we could let the child decide their own path, though this risks wasting such a rare gift."
asur_events.4.a:0 "Send them to the White Tower of Hoeth!"
asur_events.4.b:0 "Bring her into the army."
asur_events.4.c:0 "Let the child decide."

asur_events.5.title:0 "The Swordmaster’s Challenge"
asur_events.5.desc:0 "One of the Swordmasters of Hoeth, a peerless scholar and warrior, has issued a challenge to the finest swordsman in our court. This duel of honor is to be fought in full view of the nobility, showcasing the skill and discipline that defines the Asur. The victor will bring glory to their house and inspire all who bear witness.\n\nHowever, such contests are not without risk. A loss would be a humiliation, and even victory could come at a great personal cost to the participants. Shall we accept the challenge, or decline in order to avoid the uncertainty of battle?"
asur_events.5.a:0 "Accept the Duel."
asur_events.5.b:0 "Reject the Duel."

asur_events.6.title:0 "A Failing Waystone"
asur_events.6.desc:0 "One of the ancient waystones that protects Ulthuan has begun to falter, its energies dissipating into the winds. These sacred stones are the foundation of our homeland's stability, keeping the tides of chaos at bay. Without it, the delicate balance of magic that shields Ulthuan could be disrupted, leaving our realm vulnerable to ruin.\n\nOur mages believe the stone can be repaired, but doing so will require significant resources. Shall we invest in its restoration, or risk allowing it to crumble and destabilize the fragile magic of our lands?"
asur_events.6.a:0 "Repair the Stone."
asur_events.6.b:0 "Let it fall."

asur_events.7.title:0 "Call of the Forests"
asur_events.7.desc:0 "A growing number of our people feel the call of Avelorn, the enchanted forests blessed by the goddess Isha. They yearn for peace and solitude, desiring to leave behind their duties and obligations to seek refuge among the tranquil glades. While this would offer them peace, it would deprive our kingdom of valuable citizens.\n\nWe must decide how to respond. Should we permit these dreamers to leave, granting them the peace they seek? Or shall we press them into service to remind them of their duties to the kingdom? Perhaps harsher measures could deter others from following this path in the future."
asur_events.7.a:0 "Let them go!"
asur_events.7.b:0 "Some army time will do them good."
asur_events.7.c:0 "Punish those who would leave, and take their lands."

asur_events.100.title:0 "The Breaking of the Asur"
asur_events.100.desc:0 "Once, the High Elves of Ulthuan were the undisputed masters of the world — wise, graceful, and mighty beyond reckoning. From the white spires of Lothern to the moonlit glades of Avelorn, their dominion stretched in splendor, their artistry unmatched, their blades swift and sure.\n\nBut no longer. Though still noble, the Asur are diminished. Their people dwindle, their ancient cities echo with silence, and their spirit strains beneath the weight of centuries. The world has moved on, and the High Elves, proud and weary, must decide how to face its relentless tide.\n\nNow, the harmony of Ulthuan shatters. The Phoenix King Finubar the Seafarer, long a recluse in distant diplomacy, calls for renewed engagement with the wider world. Trade, alliances, and openness, he claims, are the only way to restore Ulthuan’s prestige and protect its future.\n\nOpposing him is Alarielle the Radiant, Everqueen and Avatar of Isha, who warns that the Asur must turn inward. Only by sealing Ulthuan’s shores and cleansing foreign influence can their people preserve their ancient ways and weather the age of decline.\n\nBut debate has escated into armed conflict. Brother turns against sister, lord against prince, as the sundered banners of civil war unfurl across the island. This war shall be known as the Breaking of the Asur — and in its wake, the fate of elvenkind shall be forever changed.\n\nTo placate the long-lived Asur in this time of strife, the throne passes more freely. Every 20 years, a new election is held between the Phoenix King and his dominions. The winner becomes the new Phoenix King."
asur_events.100.a:0 "May the gods have mercy upon our souls."

war_claim_the_phoenix_throne_title:0 "Claim the Phoenix Throne"
war_claim_the_phoenix_throne_desc:0 "With no Phoenix King to unite the Asur, Ulthuan stands rudderless, vulnerable to strife and foreign ambition. The sacred flame of the monarchy flickers in the wind. If we hold the heart of Ulthuan — the Shrine of Asuryan itself — then the right to rule is ours to seize. By ancient rite and sovereign strength, we shall don the crown of flame and restore order to our people."
