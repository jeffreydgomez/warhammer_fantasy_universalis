 naggaroth_power_struggle_desc:0 "The power of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has erroded over time as the estates gain more and more power in this decadent society. In a culture that believes the strong do as they please while the weak suffer as they must, questions about the strength of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] have arisen. There are some who believe it is time for a change in leadership, and it's going to be everyone's problem."

 naggaroth_power_struggle_events.1.desc:0 "The Empire of Naggaroth has stood for millenia led by the son of Aenarion, Malekith, but now it faces a time of internal strife never before seen. The Dreadlords have grown sick of fearing execution for minor defeats and seek to establish their own realms, the Corsairs see an opportunity to exert control over the army and make the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] dependent on their slave soldiers, the Cult of Khaine is simplying joining in on the bloodshed as an act of worship to Khaine, and the Merchants while not in open rebellion are using the opportunity to offer high interest loans to all sides."

 naggaroth_power_struggle_events.2.desc:0 "The disastrous struggle between the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the esates of Naggaroth has finished, and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] rules in the city of Naggarond. Dead bodies litter the streets, fires rage all over the place, and screams fill the air. In other words things are back to normal. Let's get back to killing the high elves."

 naggaroth_power_struggle_events.3.desc:0 "The Dreadlords question [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s ability to lead. They claim that Naggaroth's years of fruitless conflict against Ulthuan are [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s fault. Obviously they have no understanding of the situation, but the accusation has hurt your legitimacy regardless."
 naggaroth_power_struggle_events.3.a:0 "The Dreadlords are obviously high elf agents."

 naggaroth_power_struggle_events.5.desc:0 "The administration of the government is in a worrying state. Tasks which were once a question of a few days are dragged on for whole weeks if not months. This issue is especially noticeable in our treasury as even the least amount of bookkeeping and bureaucracy is more costly than worth it."
 naggaroth_power_struggle_events.5.a:0 "They still need to be done. Invest the money for it."
 naggaroth_power_struggle_events.5.b:0 "The bookkeeping can wait. It's not worth going into bankruptcy because of it."

 naggaroth_power_struggle_events.7.desc:0 "As the struggle for changing the status quo of the state becomes increasingly apparent, the officials and members of the court see opportunity to enrich themselves. Corruption at the royal palace as well as all lower state houses has become normalcy."

 naggaroth_power_struggle_events.8.t:0 "Inefficient Bureaucracy"
 naggaroth_power_struggle_events.8.desc:0 "Many systems of the government were established during the early days of the empire. As such they are based on old traditions instead of efficiency. This has been especially noticeable nowadays as governors and officials put way less priority in their tasks than they should."
 naggaroth_power_struggle_events.8.a:0 "That is unfortunate."
