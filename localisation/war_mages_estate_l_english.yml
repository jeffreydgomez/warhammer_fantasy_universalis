estate_mages_magical_court:0 "A Court of Sorcery"
estate_mages_magical_court_desc:0 "By embracing the guidance of spellcasters, our realm gains legitimacy in mystical matters. However, the reliance on sorcery unsettles traditionalists."

estate_mages_war_wizards:0 "Battlefield Sorcery"
estate_mages_war_wizards_desc:0 "Magic is a weapon, and our wizards shall wield it on the battlefield. Yet such power is fickle, and some doubt the wisdom of relying on spellcasters in war."

estate_mages_study_aqshy:0 "Study the Wind of Aqshy"
estate_mages_study_aqshy_desc:0 "The Wind of Aqshy, the Lore of Fire, is a raging inferno of destructive energy. Its study grants mastery over flames, but its volatile nature fuels fear among the populace."

estate_mages_study_azyr:0 "Study the Wind of Azyr"
estate_mages_study_azyr_desc:0 "The Wind of Azyr, the Lore of Heavens, grants insight into fate and the celestial order. While scholars marvel at its revelations, many fear the consequences of peering too deeply into destiny."

estate_mages_study_chamon:0 "Study the Wind of Chamon"
estate_mages_study_chamon_desc:0 "The Wind of Chamon, the Lore of Metal, reveals the secrets of transmutation and alchemy. Its application bolsters industry, though many distrust those who twist nature’s form."

estate_mages_study_ghur_desc:0 "The Wind of Ghur, the Lore of Beasts, is primal and untamed, calling to the warrior spirit of the land. Yet, its raw power evokes unease among those who fear losing themselves to bestial instincts."

estate_mages_study_ghyran_desc:0 "The Wind of Ghyran, the Lore of Life, nourishes the land and brings renewal. While its blessings are undeniable, some suspect that meddling with nature’s cycles invites unforeseen consequences."

estate_mages_study_hysh:0 "Study the Wind of Hysh"

estate_mages_study_shyish_desc:0 "The Wind of Shyish, the Lore of Death, governs the passage between life and the afterlife. While its knowledge aids those who walk the border of mortality, whispers of necromantic corruption are never far behind."

estate_mages_study_ulgu:0 "Study the Wind of Ulgu"
estate_mages_study_ulgu_desc:0 "The Wind of Ulgu, the Lore of Shadows, conceals and deceives, granting mastery over illusion. Yet, those who dwell in darkness too long are often met with suspicion and paranoia."

estate_mages_influence_of_morathi:0 "Influence of Morathi"
estate_mages_influence_of_morathi_desc:0 "The Hag Sorceress weaves her influence through every corner of courtly life, spreading the Cult of Pleasure with silken words and whispered threats. While her presence undermines religious unity and the integrity of governance, her dark patronage breeds cunning, innovation, and ruthless efficiency."

estate_mages_cult_under_the_monarch:0 "The Royal Cult"
estate_mages_cult_under_the_monarch_desc:0 "The Monarch has asserted their dominance over the Cult of Pleasure, binding its arcane hedonism to the throne. Though this alliance stains our realm with impiety, it channels forbidden knowledge and unorthodox methods of control to strengthen the state. Pleasure and power, entwined under the sovereign's will."

estate_mages_monarch_in_the_cult:0 "Monarch in the Cult"
estate_mages_monarch_in_the_cult_desc:0 "Rather than dominate, the Monarch submits to the whispering temptations of the Cult of Pleasure. Slaanesh’s decadent emissaries flood the court with vice and revelation. Innovation and espionage thrive—but at the cost of sovereign authority and fractured religious order."

estate_disasters.25.t:0 "The Mages Seize Control"
estate_disasters.25.d:0 "For too long, this nation has been guided by short-sighted rulers, ignorant of the deeper mysteries that shape our reality. Petty concerns of taxation, war, and diplomacy have distracted from the pursuit of true enlightenment. No longer.\n\nWith their unmatched knowledge and arcane prowess, the Mages have set aside the failings of the mundane and assumed leadership. Progress must be made, and the arcane arts shall be our guiding light. Of course, the lesser minds will resist—such is the burden of the enlightened."
estate_disasters.25.a:0 "Knowledge must be upheld, at any cost."

estate_disasters.26.t:0 "The Mages Brought to Heel"
estate_disasters.26.d:0 "At last, the iron grip of the Mages has been broken. Their reign, marked by arrogance and disregard for worldly matters, has left the nation in turmoil. While they sought enlightenment, they allowed the foundations of the state to crumble beneath them.\n\nStripped of their absolute authority, the Mages retreat to their sanctuaries, grumbling about the ignorance of the common folk. Though they are no longer in power, their influence lingers—and who can say when they might rise again, convinced that only they are fit to rule?"
estate_disasters.26.a:0 "Let order be restored."

curtail_estate_mages_title:0 "Curtail the Mages' Rule"
curtail_estate_mages_desc:0 "The Mages have overstepped their bounds, forsaking governance in favor of their esoteric pursuits. While their reign has granted great arcane advancements, it has also alienated the people, disrupted the economy, and weakened our authority. If we are to restore order, we must strip them of their unchecked power.\n\nHowever, removing the Mages will not be easy. They will resist, retreating into their hidden sanctuaries, plotting their return. The price of reclaiming control will be high, but no nation can endure under the rule of scholars who care more for forbidden knowledge than for the realm they govern."
