 war_convert_events.1.t:0 "[Root.GetName] has Embraced Vampirism"
war_convert_events.1.d:0 "The veil of night falls permanently upon [Root.GetName]. Ancient pacts have been made, and blood has been spilt to seal our allegiance to the dark gift. The rulers now stalk the shadows, undead yet regal, guiding our destiny with immortal precision. \n\nThe sun is no longer welcome here. Our society shall thrive in the cold hush of moonlight, as eternal life offers a path to dominion over both the living and the dead. With every beat of a mortal heart, our power grows."
war_convert_events.1.option_1:0 "Bring on the night."

war_convert_events.2.t:0 "[Root.GetName] has Embraced the Cytharai"
war_convert_events.2.d:0 "We have cast aside the illusions of mercy and turned our eyes to the true gods of Naggaroth—the Cytharai. Their whispers echo in our minds, offering power through cruelty, ambition, and fear. We now walk the path of malice, as is fitting for those who seek dominion through strength.\n\nBlood, pain, and sacrifice are not burdens but sacraments. The gods of the Druchii demand no less, and we shall offer them a nation forged in terror and supremacy. Let all who stand before us tremble."
war_convert_events.2.option_1:0 "Bring on the dark."

war_convert_events.3.t:0 "[Root.GetName] has Embraced Nagash Worship"
war_convert_events.3.d:0 "Nagash, the Great Necromancer, has risen in our hearts and minds. His doctrine of undeath, power, and conquest is no longer heresy—it is our creed. The winds of magic shall bend to our will, and the dead shall serve our purpose.\n\nWe do not fear death; we command it. With Nagash as our god and master, no empire shall outlast us, for our dominion is eternal. From tomb to throne, we shall rule."
war_convert_events.3.option_1:0 "Nagash is eternal."

war_convert_events.4.t:0 "[Root.GetName] has Embraced Khorne"
war_convert_events.4.d:0 "The drums of war beat louder than ever. Khorne, the Blood God, has claimed us, and we shall answer his call with steel, rage, and slaughter. Mercy is weakness, peace is blasphemy, and victory is the only truth.\n\nWe reject all sorcery, all cowardice, and all compromise. Blood shall flow, and skulls shall be piled high upon the altars of wrath. This is our sacred duty—eternal war for the glory of Khorne."
war_convert_events.4.option_1:0 "Blood for the Blood God!"

war_convert_events.5.t:0 "[Root.GetName] has Embraced Nurgle"
war_convert_events.5.d:0 "Decay is not a curse but a blessing. The Plaguefather welcomes us with rot, resilience, and the peace that comes from accepting entropy. In Nurgle’s garden, all things find their place, transformed by corruption and made whole in suffering.\n\nWe are not weakened by disease—we are strengthened by it. Our people endure where others perish, bound together by pestilence and love. The world shall know despair, and it shall be beautiful."
war_convert_events.5.option_1:0 "Spread plague, and more."

war_convert_events.6.t:0 "[Root.GetName] has Embraced Tzeentch"
war_convert_events.6.d:0 "Tzeentch, the Changer of Ways, has woven us into his grand design. Nothing is as it seems, and all things are mutable under his gaze. Magic, secrets, and ambition shall be our instruments of transformation.\n\nOur realm becomes a crucible of plots and power. Knowledge is our weapon, and deceit our shield. In embracing the Architect of Fate, we become more than rulers—we become destiny itself."
war_convert_events.6.option_1:0 "Praise the Changer of Ways."

war_convert_events.7.t:0 "[Root.GetName] has Embraced Slaanesh"
war_convert_events.7.d:0 "Perfection, excess, and ecstasy now guide our hearts. The Dark Prince has claimed us, and we revel in sensations beyond mortal understanding. Beauty and horror entwine in a dance of endless indulgence.\n\nWe reject restraint and moderation. Power lies in desire unbound, and we shall rise by surrendering to passion and embracing the sublime. Let the world gape in awe—and envy."
war_convert_events.7.option_1:0 "Pleasure shall be ours"

war_convert_events.8.t:0 "[Root.GetName] has Embraced Chaos Undivided"
war_convert_events.8.d:0 "All the gods of Chaos now dwell within our hearts. Khorne’s fury, Nurgle’s decay, Tzeentch’s scheming, and Slaanesh’s allure—none are denied. In unity, there is ruinous strength, and we wield it without shame or hesitation.\n\nWe are no longer of this world. We are its undoing, its rebirth in nightmare. Our banner is the eight-pointed star, and all shall bow before the power of Chaos Undivided."
war_convert_events.8.option_1:0 "Glory to the Dark Gods!"
