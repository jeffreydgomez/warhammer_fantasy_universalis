war_resisted_dark_gift:0 "Resisted Dark Gift"
war_resisted_dark_gift_desc:0 "We have resisted the temptation of power from a dark stranger. Our Gods shall not be so quickly cast aside."

 
 war_convert_events.1.t:0 "[Root.GetName] has Embraced Vampirism"
war_convert_events.1.d:0 "The veil of night falls permanently upon [Root.GetName]. Ancient pacts have been made, and blood has been spilt to seal our allegiance to the dark gift. The rulers now stalk the shadows, undead yet regal, guiding our destiny with immortal precision. \n\nThe sun is no longer welcome here. Our society shall thrive in the cold hush of moonlight, as eternal life offers a path to dominion over both the living and the dead. With every beat of a mortal heart, our power grows."
war_convert_events.1.option_1:0 "Bring on the night."

war_convert_events.2.t:0 "[Root.GetName] has Embraced the Cytharai"
war_convert_events.2.d:0 "We have cast aside the illusions of mercy and turned our eyes to the true gods of Naggaroth—the Cytharai. Their whispers echo in our minds, offering power through cruelty, ambition, and fear. We now walk the path of malice, as is fitting for those who seek dominion through strength.\n\nBlood, pain, and sacrifice are not burdens but sacraments. The gods of the Druchii demand no less, and we shall offer them a nation forged in terror and supremacy. Let all who stand before us tremble."
war_convert_events.2.option_1:0 "Bring on the dark."

war_convert_events.3.t:0 "[Root.GetName] has Embraced Nagash Worship"
war_convert_events.3.d:0 "Nagash, the Great Necromancer, has risen in our hearts and minds. His doctrine of undeath, power, and conquest is no longer heresy—it is our creed. The winds of magic shall bend to our will, and the dead shall serve our purpose.\n\nWe do not fear death; we command it. With Nagash as our god and master, no empire shall outlast us, for our dominion is eternal. From tomb to throne, we shall rule."
war_convert_events.3.option_1:0 "Nagash is eternal."

war_convert_events.4.t:0 "[Root.GetName] has Embraced Khorne"
war_convert_events.4.d:0 "The drums of war beat louder than ever. Khorne, the Blood God, has claimed us, and we shall answer his call with steel, rage, and slaughter. Mercy is weakness, peace is blasphemy, and victory is the only truth.\n\nWe reject all sorcery, all cowardice, and all compromise. Blood shall flow, and skulls shall be piled high upon the altars of wrath. This is our sacred duty—eternal war for the glory of Khorne."
war_convert_events.4.option_1:0 "Blood for the Blood God!"

war_convert_events.5.t:0 "[Root.GetName] has Embraced Nurgle"
war_convert_events.5.d:0 "Decay is not a curse but a blessing. The Plaguefather welcomes us with rot, resilience, and the peace that comes from accepting entropy. In Nurgle’s garden, all things find their place, transformed by corruption and made whole in suffering.\n\nWe are not weakened by disease—we are strengthened by it. Our people endure where others perish, bound together by pestilence and love. The world shall know despair, and it shall be beautiful."
war_convert_events.5.option_1:0 "Spread plague, and more."

war_convert_events.6.t:0 "[Root.GetName] has Embraced Tzeentch"
war_convert_events.6.d:0 "Tzeentch, the Changer of Ways, has woven us into his grand design. Nothing is as it seems, and all things are mutable under his gaze. Magic, secrets, and ambition shall be our instruments of transformation.\n\nOur realm becomes a crucible of plots and power. Knowledge is our weapon, and deceit our shield. In embracing the Architect of Fate, we become more than rulers—we become destiny itself."
war_convert_events.6.option_1:0 "Praise the Changer of Ways."

war_convert_events.7.t:0 "[Root.GetName] has Embraced Slaanesh"
war_convert_events.7.d:0 "Perfection, excess, and ecstasy now guide our hearts. The Dark Prince has claimed us, and we revel in sensations beyond mortal understanding. Beauty and horror entwine in a dance of endless indulgence.\n\nWe reject restraint and moderation. Power lies in desire unbound, and we shall rise by surrendering to passion and embracing the sublime. Let the world gape in awe—and envy."
war_convert_events.7.option_1:0 "Pleasure shall be ours"

war_convert_events.8.t:0 "[Root.GetName] has Embraced Chaos Undivided"
war_convert_events.8.d:0 "All the gods of Chaos now dwell within our hearts. Khorne’s fury, Nurgle’s decay, Tzeentch’s scheming, and Slaanesh’s allure—none are denied. In unity, there is ruinous strength, and we wield it without shame or hesitation.\n\nWe are no longer of this world. We are its undoing, its rebirth in nightmare. Our banner is the eight-pointed star, and all shall bow before the power of Chaos Undivided."
war_convert_events.8.option_1:0 "Glory to the Dark Gods!"


war_convert_events.11.t:0 "The Dark Gift of Undeath"
war_convert_events.11.d:0 "A figure cloaked in black finery has arrived at court—pale of skin, ancient of eye, and possessed of a seductive charisma that chills the blood. This emissary of undeath speaks of eternity, of strength unbound by age or mortality, and of a power that can unshackle our people from the chains of time.\n\nThe price is steep, of course. The soul must be bartered away, the body made vessel for unholy might. But with the Dark Gift, we would command fear, not suffer it. Will we drink deep of this crimson path?"
war_convert_events.11.option_1:0 "We will not be monsters."
war_convert_events.11.option_2:0 "Eternity beckons—we shall embrace the night."

war_convert_events.12.t:0 "The Whisper of Shadow"
war_convert_events.12.d:0 "A lithe and cruel-eyed emissary from the shadowed depths of Naggaroth offers a new creed to our kin—a creed of cruelty, dominance, and ecstatic suffering. The Cytharai promise power born not from harmony but from strife, from the ecstasy of domination and the beauty of destruction.\n\nThey speak in silken tones of a life without restraint, a realm ruled by cunning and strength. Should we cast off the shackles of restraint and embrace the elven gods of shadow, our path shall be one of terror and triumph alike."
war_convert_events.12.option_1:0 "We are not slaves to shadow."
war_convert_events.12.option_2:0 "Let the old gods burn—hail the Cytharai."

war_convert_events.13.t:0 "The Doctrine of Nagash"
war_convert_events.13.d:0 "From the ash-choked sands comes a messenger, robed in the funerary garb of the Great Necromancer. He speaks of Nagash, the First and Final King, who conquered death and would see the world kneel before undeath eternal.\n\nTo embrace this path is to scorn the gods and rewrite the natural order in our image. Yet through his dark wisdom, nations have risen from dust and waged war upon time itself. Will we kneel to Nagash—and rise anew, forevermore?"
war_convert_events.13.option_1:0 "Nagash is a curse, not a savior."
war_convert_events.13.option_2:0 "The will of death shall guide us."

war_convert_events.14.t:0 "Blood for the Blood God"
war_convert_events.14.d:0 "A war-scarred emissary, soaked in blood and speaking in tongues of rage, brings word of Khorne, Lord of Skulls. The weak perish; the strong conquer. This is the truth that Khorne offers, and all other faiths are lies smothered in cowardice.\n\nTo embrace the Blood God is to forsake diplomacy, peace, and mercy. In their place, we would gain wrath, strength, and the endless glory of conquest. Shall we offer up our souls in battle, and drown the world in blood?"
war_convert_events.14.option_1:0 "Khorne’s madness has no place here."
war_convert_events.14.option_2:0 "Let blood flow—we fight for the Skull Throne."

war_convert_events.15.t:0 "The Rotfather's Gift"
war_convert_events.15.d:0 "The emissary stinks of decay, his smile putrid yet warm. He speaks of Nurgle, the Lord of Plagues, who loves his children unconditionally and grants them the resilience of rot and the endurance of corruption.\n\nPain and sickness, he claims, are illusions. To rot is to renew. In Nurgle's embrace, we would never fear famine, never fear death—for death itself would fear us. Will we accept his loving touch?"
war_convert_events.15.option_1:0 "We reject his rot."
war_convert_events.15.option_2:0 "We embrace the Father of Decay."

war_convert_events.16.t:0 "The Path of Change"
war_convert_events.16.d:0 "A masked figure of shifting shape and impossible eyes comes bearing the gospel of Tzeentch, Changer of Ways. Magic, ambition, and transformation—these are the truths he offers, and the chains he would help us break.\n\nOrder is stagnation. Through Tzeentch, we may wield fate itself as a weapon, shaping realms through cunning and sorcery. Will we embrace the Great Architect and remake our destiny in his ever-changing image?"
war_convert_events.16.option_1:0 "We will not be pawns in Tzeentch’s game."
war_convert_events.16.option_2:0 "Change is inevitable. Let us be its masters."

war_convert_events.17.t:0 "The Lure of Excess"
war_convert_events.17.d:0 "A radiant figure, beautiful and terrible, arrives bearing gifts of silk, song, and whispered temptation. They speak of Slaanesh, Prince of Pleasure, and offer a creed of passion, perfection, and transcendence through sensation.\n\nTo walk this path is to indulge every desire, to pursue artistry in every act of cruelty or ecstasy. Through devotion to Slaanesh, we shall rise above the dross of mortality and experience every limit—only to break it anew."
war_convert_events.17.option_1:0 "We will not fall to indulgence."
war_convert_events.17.option_2:0 "Let pleasure reign, and all else fade."

war_convert_events.18.t:0 "The Unifying Darkness"
war_convert_events.18.d:0 "A black-armored warrior, marked by the signs of all the Dark Gods, arrives with a simple offer: unity in corruption. Chaos Undivided calls to us, promising power through devotion not to one ruinous master, but to all.\n\nThis path is the most perilous of all. To embrace Chaos in its fullness is to become vessel and champion to a pantheon of madness, mutation, and war. Yet through this madness lies ultimate dominion. Shall we surrender all to Chaos?"
war_convert_events.18.option_1:0 "Chaos will not take root here."
war_convert_events.18.option_2:0 "We shall rise—one nation, one will, one Chaos."
