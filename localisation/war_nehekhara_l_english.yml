nehekharan_please_nobility_desc:0 "Nehekhara is a land of many kings, each ruling over their own domains with absolute authority. Though we may claim supreme rule, our power is nothing without the loyalty of our fellow monarchs and their legions.\n\nBy securing their allegiance and proving our right to rule, we will command the full strength of Nehekhara. Only then can we begin the work of restoring our civilization to its former glory."

nehekharan_strong_army_1_title:0 "Train the Generals"
nehekharan_strong_army_1_desc:0 "The undead are tireless, but tirelessness alone does not win wars. Proper command and discipline must be instilled into our skeletal legions if they are to rival the armies of the living.\n\nTo achieve this, we must establish academies where our finest warriors can refine their craft. Even a skeleton can be made into an elite soldier under the right leadership."

nehekharan_strong_army_2_title:0 "Expand the Academy"

nehekharan_king_of_kings_1_desc:0 "True power is not merely ruling over one's own kind, but commanding the loyalty of those who would otherwise stand against us.

Their lands, their soldiers, and their resources will serve Nehekhara, ensuring our eternal supremacy."

nehekharan_king_of_kings_3_desc:0 "We stand on the precipice of true greatness. Our empire spans vast lands, ruling over numerous peoples who now march to our command. Yet there is still more to conquer.\n\nWith every new vassal, our grip on the world tightens. We are no longer just the rulers of Nehekhara—we are the masters of all we survey. None shall contest our might, for all who live and die belong to us."

nehekharan_symbols_of_power_1_desc:0 "The monuments of Nehekhara stand as testaments to our ancient greatness, yet many now lie in foreign hands. To rule as the rightful sovereign, we must bring these relics back under our control.\n\nSecuring these grand works will send a clear message: we are the true rulers of Nehekhara. Those who would deny us shall find themselves swept aside by the tide of history."

nehekharan_symbols_of_power_2_title:0 "Prove Our Legitimacy"
nehekharan_symbols_of_power_2_desc:0 "Claiming these relics is not enough—our control over them must be undisputed.

The greatest wonders of Nehekhara stand once more under our command, their power fueling our eternal dominion.\n\nWe have surpassed the rulers of old, proving that our dynasty alone is worthy of leading this empire into the future. The sands bow before us, as does all who dwell upon them."

nehekharan_reform_government_title:0 "Reform the Kingdom"
nehekharan_reform_government_desc:0 "The old ways have preserved us, but stagnation is the enemy of greatness. If we are to endure for eternity, we must ensure that our governance is as unyielding as our armies.\n\nBy reshaping our institutions, we will forge a kingdom suited for the trials of this age. A ruler who does not adapt is doomed to crumble into dust."

nehekhara_reforge_capital_title:0 "Restore the Capital"
nehekhara_reforge_capital_desc:0 "Our capital, once the jewel of Nehekhara, has suffered from centuries of neglect and ruin.

nehekhara_control_nehekhara_desc:0 "For too long, the lands of Nehekhara have been divided, with petty warlords and foreign invaders sullying the sands of our ancestors.

nehekharan_built_up_monuments_title:0 "Restore the Monuments"

It is our duty to restore them, ensuring that their legacy endures for all time.\n\nWith each monument rebuilt, the power of Nehekhara strengthens. These are more than mere relics—they are the foundation upon which our eternal empire shall stand."

nehekhara_expell_foreigners_title:0 "Purge the Foreigners"
nehekhara_expell_foreigners_desc:0 "The lands of Nehekhara belong to the kings of old, not to the foreign interlopers who now tread upon our sacred sands. Their presence is an insult to our ancestors.\n\nWe shall expel them, ensuring that Nehekhara is ruled only by those who honor its traditions. Let no outsider think they can claim dominion here."

nehekhara_leader_of_southlands_title:0 "Master of the Southlands"
nehekhara_leader_of_southlands_desc:0 "Our dominion stretches across Nehekhara, but true supremacy demands more.

None shall challenge our eternal reign."

Without their expertise, our civilization would be nothing but dust and crumbling ruins.\n\nWe must earn their favor, granting them the resources and authority they need to rebuild our cities and monuments. In return, they will ensure that Nehekhara stands eternal, as grand as it once was."

nehekharan_monument_builders_title:0 "Monument Builders"
nehekharan_monument_builders_desc:0 "The Necrotects require more than just recognition—they need materials to shape their grand designs. The great pyramids and temples of Nehekhara were built upon the backs of an entire empire's labor and wealth.\n\nBy securing the finest resources—gold, ivory, gems, and stone—we shall empower the Necrotects to restore Nehekhara’s splendor. The monuments they craft will stand as testaments to our divine rule."

nehekharan_reanimate_the_ushabti_title:0 "Reanimate the Ushabti"

nehekharan_trade_routes_1_title:0 "Revive the Trade Routes"
nehekharan_trade_routes_1_desc:0 "Once, the riches of Nehekhara flowed across the world, its cities serving as the beating heart of trade.

The gods will see our devotion and grant us their continued favor."

nehekharan_ritual_3_title:0 "Greater Sacrifices"

No mere handful of lives will suffice—we need thousands.\n\nWith the ritual now perfected, a mass sacrifice shall fuel the spell.

nehekharan_religious_city_2_title:0 "Expand the Pilgrimage City"
nehekharan_religious_city_2_desc:0 "Our religious city has become a focal point of worship, but its potential is far from realized.

nehekharan_green_deserts_1_desc:0 "Long ago, Nehekhara was a land of verdant fields, flowing rivers, and abundant harvests. But disaster and neglect have left it a barren wasteland, the sands swallowing what was once fertile.\n\nNow, through magic and ingenuity, we can begin to restore our homeland to its former splendor. By reshaping the land itself, we will prove that even nature bends to the will of Nehekhara."

nehekharan_green_deserts_2_title:0 "Expand the Green Horizon"

Let the world see what we have accomplished, for Nehekhara is no longer a kingdom of the dead—it is a paradise reborn."

### Events


tomb_king.3.title:0 "Caught in the Act"  
tomb_king.3.desc:0 "Two grave robbers have been apprehended while attempting to loot one of your sacred tombs. These audacious thieves dared to defile the resting place of one of Nehekhara’s honored dead, seeking to plunder its ancient treasures. Though their crime is unforgivable, the robbers plead for their lives, offering a share of the stolen riches to secure your mercy. \n\nYour priests and advisors are divided. Some argue that the looters should be executed to set an example and the treasures returned to the tomb, as per Nehekharan tradition. Others suggest keeping the treasures for the kingdom's benefit and ensuring their punishment remains swift. Or perhaps you could even encourage them to seek more loot, for wealth has its uses—even if it comes from dishonorable means."  
tomb_king.3.a:0 "Kill them, and return the loot."  
tomb_king.3.b:0 "Kill them and keep the loot."  
tomb_king.3.c:0 "Go get some more!"

The assembled skeleton warriors and priests, loyal as they are, appear visibly uncomfortable, with some suppressing awkward chuckles. Even in undeath, the pursuit of regal dignity proves to be an ongoing challenge.  \n\nThis small embarrassment may weaken your image if not addressed. You could ignore it, making light of the situation and embracing your undead nature for what it is. Alternatively, you could take steps to remedy this indignity, either through simple repair or by crafting a magnificent golden jaw to reinforce your aura of godhood."

tomb_king.4.b:0 "Nothing some bandages can't fix."

tomb_king.5.desc:0 "Reports from your generals reveal a dire phenomenon gripping your armies. Entire companies of skeleton soldiers are collapsing into heaps of brittle bones without explanation, leaving gaps in your once-formidable formations. The generals theorize that the enchantments binding the souls of your warriors are beginning to decay, but the cause remains unclear.  \n\nYour advisors present three paths forward. You could choose to let the weak crumble, focusing on the stability of your remaining forces. Alternatively, a modest magical ritual might slow the decay at some cost, or you could command the necromancers to intensify their efforts and cast a grand incantation to fully restore your legions. Whatever you decide, time is of the essence."  
tomb_king.5.a:0 "Let them crumble, we have more."

tomb_king.6.title:0 "The Curse of Nagash"  
tomb_king.6.desc:0 "A foul corruption spreads across the lands of Nehekhara, its touch blighting all that it encounters. The oases dry up, turning to poisoned pools, and the skeletal legions grow restless, as if they sense a greater malevolence at work. The Liche Priests whisper that this is the work of Nagash’s lingering malice, a curse woven into the very sands that bind Nehekhara together.\n\nThis blight cannot be ignored, for it threatens the stability of your kingdom and the loyalty of your subjects. You may decide to defy Nagash’s curse, enduring the hardships and rallying your people against this unseen foe. Or, as your priests timidly suggest, you could seek to appease Nagash’s spirit, though doing so would risk your dignity and might embolden his cult."  
tomb_king.6.a:0 "We shall endure. Nehekhara bows to no one!"

tomb_king.7.desc:0 "The air grows heavy with divine fury as a great sandstorm descends upon your lands. Crops are buried beneath shifting dunes, settlements collapse under the weight of the storm, and your skeleton warriors struggle to stand amidst the howling winds. The priests declare that Usirian, god of the underworld, has grown displeased with your reign and has unleashed his wrath upon Nehekhara.\n\nThe choices before you are perilous. A grand sacrifice could be offered to appease Usirian, but the cost would be steep. Alternatively, you could weather the storm, allowing it to pass and rebuilding in its aftermath, though this would cause untold devastation. Perhaps, however, the storm could be redirected through sheer will, harnessed as a weapon to smite your enemies."

Their towering pyramids, vast necropolises, and intricate carvings defy the passage of time, proclaiming to the world that Nehekhara's legacy shall endure forever. These wonders were not just built for mortals to admire, but for the gods themselves to envy.\n\nAs you stand before one of these mighty structures, a rare moment of reflection overtakes you. The pride of Nehekhara courses through your veins, and you realize that the achievements of your civilization are unmatched by any other. How should this legacy be immortalized? Through your monuments, your civilization, or your unbroken bloodline?"

tomb_king.9.title:0 "The Nagashi Cult"  
tomb_king.9.desc:0 "Rumors have surfaced of a hidden cult operating within your lands, worshipping none other than Nagash, the Great Necromancer. These heretics speak of a dark ascension and whisper promises of forbidden power to those who join them. While their presence is a threat to the stability of Nehekhara, they also bring with them rare knowledge and, in some cases, bribes of gold. \n\nThe Mortuary Cult advises rooting out these heretics immediately to prevent their influence from spreading. Others in your court, however, argue that such knowledge could be exploited to strengthen your kingdom, provided you are willing to risk the ire of the gods. The decision lies in your hands—shall you purge the cult, cautiously tolerate their ideas, or accept their gifts in exchange for leniency?"

The priests of Usirian, the ruler of the underworld, declare that this storm is no natural phenomenon but a sign of the god's displeasure with your rule. His judgment is clear—your leadership has strayed from the balance he demands.\n\nThe sandstorm's fury is relentless, devastating fields and scattering the living and the dead alike. The council debates the proper course of action. Some advocate for a grand sacrifice to appease Usirian's anger. Others suggest enduring the storm's destruction, letting it run its course. There is also a bold suggestion: redirect the storm, turning its wrath against your enemies beyond the borders of your realm."

Necromantic energy floods the land, creeping into every crevice and suffusing the air with an unnatural chill. We underestimated the forces we sought to command, and now, the consequences are undeniable.\n\nHalf measures will not suffice—our ambitions must be greater, and our will stronger. The priests have failed us, their knowledge woefully insufficient. They shall be sacrificed, for their deaths will serve a far greater purpose than their pitiful lives ever could."
tomb_king.151.a:0 "We must try again!"

tomb_king.152.title:0 "Fools Who Do Not Understand"
tomb_king.152.desc:0 "As the ritual nears its peak, a group of advisors storms into the chamber, pleading for us to cease our efforts. They prattle on about balance, about dangers beyond our comprehension. Spineless parasites! They have neither the vision nor the courage to walk this path.\n\nThey will not dissuade us. Instead, their feeble bodies shall serve as fuel for the ritual, their essence consumed in pursuit of true power. The weak will always cower before greatness—it is only right that they be cast aside."

A group of traitorous generals has refused to accept their fate and instead mustered their troops outside the ritual site. The cowards waited until the ritual was beyond stopping, and now they dare raise arms against us.\n\nBut they are too late. The dark power we have harnessed will not be undone so easily. Their rebellion will be crushed, and their deaths shall serve as a warning to all who would question our dominion."
tomb_king.153.a:0 "We must try again!"

tomb_king.154.title:0 "A Damaged Pyramid, a Stirring World"
tomb_king.154.desc:0 "Through countless sacrifices, we have gained knowledge that few could ever hope to grasp. But the power we wield is volatile, and the ritual has taken its toll. The Black Pyramid of Nagash now bears the scars of our efforts, its structure weakened by forces beyond mortal reckoning.\n\nYet the true impact of our work extends far beyond these walls. Across the world, something stirs—the dead claw their way from their graves, restless and drawn toward an unknown call. Whether this is a sign of success or a harbinger of greater disaster remains to be seen."

The ritual is complete, its energies reshaping the world in ways that none could have foreseen. The veil between life and death has been torn asunder, and now the final choice stands before us.\n\nShall we undo the ancient curse, reclaiming the life that was stolen from us so long ago? Or shall we embrace the dark path, seizing undeath as our eternal birthright and bending the world to our will? The decision we make now will echo for all eternity."
tomb_king.155.a:0 "We shall undo our curse and return to life!"

gen_nehekhara_missions_1_desc:0 "For centuries, our power was confined to the desert. But Nehekhara was once a seafaring empire, dominating the trade routes from the western coasts to the furthest reaches of the east.
