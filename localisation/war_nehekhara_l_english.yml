The sands bow before us, as does all who dwell upon them."

If we are to endure for eternity, we must ensure that our governance is as unyielding as our armies.\n\nBy reshaping our institutions, we will forge a kingdom suited for the trials of this age. A ruler who does not adapt is doomed to crumble into dust."

nehekhara_reforge_capital_title:0 "Restore the Capital"

### Events


tomb_king.3.title:0 "Caught in the Act"  
tomb_king.3.desc:0 "Two grave robbers have been apprehended while attempting to loot one of your sacred tombs. These audacious thieves dared to defile the resting place of one of Nehekhara’s honored dead, seeking to plunder its ancient treasures. Though their crime is unforgivable, the robbers plead for their lives, offering a share of the stolen riches to secure your mercy. \n\nYour priests and advisors are divided. Some argue that the looters should be executed to set an example and the treasures returned to the tomb, as per Nehekharan tradition. Others suggest keeping the treasures for the kingdom's benefit and ensuring their punishment remains swift. Or perhaps you could even encourage them to seek more loot, for wealth has its uses—even if it comes from dishonorable means."

Even in undeath, the pursuit of regal dignity proves to be an ongoing challenge.  \n\nThis small embarrassment may weaken your image if not addressed. You could ignore it, making light of the situation and embracing your undead nature for what it is. Alternatively, you could take steps to remedy this indignity, either through simple repair or by crafting a magnificent golden jaw to reinforce your aura of godhood."

tomb_king.5.desc:0 "Reports from your generals reveal a dire phenomenon gripping your armies. Entire companies of skeleton soldiers are collapsing into heaps of brittle bones without explanation, leaving gaps in your once-formidable formations. The generals theorize that the enchantments binding the souls of your warriors are beginning to decay, but the cause remains unclear.  \n\nYour advisors present three paths forward. You could choose to let the weak crumble, focusing on the stability of your remaining forces. Alternatively, a modest magical ritual might slow the decay at some cost, or you could command the necromancers to intensify their efforts and cast a grand incantation to fully restore your legions. Whatever you decide, time is of the essence."  
tomb_king.5.a:0 "Let them crumble, we have more."  
tomb_king.5.b:0 "A magical incantation will stem the decay."

tomb_king.6.title:0 "The Curse of Nagash"  
tomb_king.6.desc:0 "A foul corruption spreads across the lands of Nehekhara, its touch blighting all that it encounters. The oases dry up, turning to poisoned pools, and the skeletal legions grow restless, as if they sense a greater malevolence at work. The Liche Priests whisper that this is the work of Nagash’s lingering malice, a curse woven into the very sands that bind Nehekhara together.\n\nThis blight cannot be ignored, for it threatens the stability of your kingdom and the loyalty of your subjects. You may decide to defy Nagash’s curse, enduring the hardships and rallying your people against this unseen foe. Or, as your priests timidly suggest, you could seek to appease Nagash’s spirit, though doing so would risk your dignity and might embolden his cult."  
tomb_king.6.a:0 "We shall endure. Nehekhara bows to no one!"  
tomb_king.6.b:0 "Seek to appease Nagash's spirit."  

tomb_king.7.title:0 "Wrath of Usirian"  
tomb_king.7.desc:0 "The air grows heavy with divine fury as a great sandstorm descends upon your lands. Crops are buried beneath shifting dunes, settlements collapse under the weight of the storm, and your skeleton warriors struggle to stand amidst the howling winds. The priests declare that Usirian, god of the underworld, has grown displeased with your reign and has unleashed his wrath upon Nehekhara.\n\nThe choices before you are perilous. A grand sacrifice could be offered to appease Usirian, but the cost would be steep. Alternatively, you could weather the storm, allowing it to pass and rebuilding in its aftermath, though this would cause untold devastation. Perhaps, however, the storm could be redirected through sheer will, harnessed as a weapon to smite your enemies."

Their towering pyramids, vast necropolises, and intricate carvings defy the passage of time, proclaiming to the world that Nehekhara's legacy shall endure forever. These wonders were not just built for mortals to admire, but for the gods themselves to envy.\n\nAs you stand before one of these mighty structures, a rare moment of reflection overtakes you. The pride of Nehekhara courses through your veins, and you realize that the achievements of your civilization are unmatched by any other. How should this legacy be immortalized? Through your monuments, your civilization, or your unbroken bloodline?"

tomb_king.9.title:0 "The Nagashi Cult"  
tomb_king.9.desc:0 "Rumors have surfaced of a hidden cult operating within your lands, worshipping none other than Nagash, the Great Necromancer. These heretics speak of a dark ascension and whisper promises of forbidden power to those who join them. While their presence is a threat to the stability of Nehekhara, they also bring with them rare knowledge and, in some cases, bribes of gold. \n\nThe Mortuary Cult advises rooting out these heretics immediately to prevent their influence from spreading. Others in your court, however, argue that such knowledge could be exploited to strengthen your kingdom, provided you are willing to risk the ire of the gods. The decision lies in your hands—shall you purge the cult, cautiously tolerate their ideas, or accept their gifts in exchange for leniency?"  
tomb_king.9.a:0 "Root it out!"  
tomb_king.9.b:0 "Well, they do have some interesting ideas."

tomb_king.10.desc:0 "The skies darken, and the winds howl as a colossal sandstorm descends upon your lands, tearing through settlements and unearthing the ancient tombs of Nehekhara. The priests of Usirian, the ruler of the underworld, declare that this storm is no natural phenomenon but a sign of the god's displeasure with your rule. His judgment is clear—your leadership has strayed from the balance he demands.\n\nThe sandstorm's fury is relentless, devastating fields and scattering the living and the dead alike. The council debates the proper course of action. Some advocate for a grand sacrifice to appease Usirian's anger. Others suggest enduring the storm's destruction, letting it run its course. There is also a bold suggestion: redirect the storm, turning its wrath against your enemies beyond the borders of your realm."

Yet the world changes, and even the undying cannot ignore the march of time.\n\nIt is clear that our government must be reforged if we are to lead Nehekhara into a new era of strength and stability. The question remains—how shall we shape our future? Will we uphold the sacred rule of the priesthood, embrace the rule of kings, or experiment with a more radical path?"

It is time to reshape our beliefs to better serve our people and our empire.\n\nThe question remains: how shall we proceed? Shall we devote ourselves to the refinement of rituals and magic, seek stability through faith and order, or embrace an evangelical path to spread our gods’ will beyond our borders?"

tomb_king.151.title:0 "The Ritual Spirals Out of Control"
tomb_king.151.desc:0 "The first attempt to replicate Nagash's ritual has gone horribly wrong. Necromantic energy floods the land, creeping into every crevice and suffusing the air with an unnatural chill. We underestimated the forces we sought to command, and now, the consequences are undeniable.\n\nHalf measures will not suffice—our ambitions must be greater, and our will stronger. The priests have failed us, their knowledge woefully insufficient. They shall be sacrificed, for their deaths will serve a far greater purpose than their pitiful lives ever could."
tomb_king.151.a:0 "We must try again!"

tomb_king.152.title:0 "Fools Who Do Not Understand"
tomb_king.152.desc:0 "As the ritual nears its peak, a group of advisors storms into the chamber, pleading for us to cease our efforts. They prattle on about balance, about dangers beyond our comprehension. Spineless parasites! They have neither the vision nor the courage to walk this path.\n\nThey will not dissuade us. Instead, their feeble bodies shall serve as fuel for the ritual, their essence consumed in pursuit of true power. The weak will always cower before greatness—it is only right that they be cast aside."

A group of traitorous generals has refused to accept their fate and instead mustered their troops outside the ritual site. The cowards waited until the ritual was beyond stopping, and now they dare raise arms against us.\n\nBut they are too late. The dark power we have harnessed will not be undone so easily. Their rebellion will be crushed, and their deaths shall serve as a warning to all who would question our dominion."

tomb_king.154.desc:0 "Through countless sacrifices, we have gained knowledge that few could ever hope to grasp. But the power we wield is volatile, and the ritual has taken its toll. The Black Pyramid of Nagash now bears the scars of our efforts, its structure weakened by forces beyond mortal reckoning.\n\nYet the true impact of our work extends far beyond these walls. Across the world, something stirs—the dead claw their way from their graves, restless and drawn toward an unknown call. Whether this is a sign of success or a harbinger of greater disaster remains to be seen."
tomb_king.154.a:0 "Success, if only temporarily!"

The veil between life and death has been torn asunder, and now the final choice stands before us.\n\nShall we undo the ancient curse, reclaiming the life that was stolen from us so long ago? Or shall we embrace the dark path, seizing undeath as our eternal birthright and bending the world to our will? The decision we make now will echo for all eternity."
tomb_king.155.a:0 "We shall undo our curse and return to life!"
