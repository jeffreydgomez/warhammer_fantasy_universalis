	non-steam needs a slightly different file structure, with the descriptor file in the mods folder alongside the mod files themselves, and a line added to point to the right directory (path="C:\Users\admin\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Europa Universalis IV\mod\warhammer_fantasy_universalis-main") but yes! works perfectly after that modification! thank you so much :)

		As Etaine I colonized some provinces in Dawn's Light (Equivalent to South Africa) but can't add them to a trade company. For references, I have all DLCs.

	Also why doesnt Ulthuan (tag) not have a Gov reform? Like even just Asur Kingdom is fine for a stopgap.

	Force religion on colony

	As a beastmen stan, sad my boy Khazrak isnt playable.

	It's a fort in an adjacent province in the underempire problem? Perhaps dwarves get vision on all underempire exits and entrances. Or, when adjacent or at war they do? People with their capitals in the underemprie get vision on all underempire exits and entrances

	Offer vassalization to dominions through the normal means?

	Nurn cannot be added to the empire - It needs to be in the continent of europe to be able to. This makes it impossible to invite the southern border princes without going around through the black fire pass?

	Two popups for ending the end times https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1315782027534008420/1317095941404229662

    Make it so that Implant cult can only target capitals if they are the only possible province

	i dont think its possible to pass the reforms without fighting all the electors: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1314656598051913818/1316839640489263136

		Position: Shaanlan in southern Cathay (province id is 2512), I have three ships that APPEAR to be located in the "Eternalhold" province, while the localisation say they are in "Ashhowl", which is a Coastalprovince.

	Add Monuments
		Also there should be various monuments in the various peaks of Vala Azril Ungol
		Shrine of Khaine as a monument?
		Oh and also I believe Black pit should be made into normal province. Since its cool place where all those huge spiders live and breed. Could possibly host two diffrent monuments even. One for goblins that use those huge spiders and commune with them to control them. 
		And the second monument or artifact could be Dark Heart. I belive i've heard somewhere that it is actually stored somwhere there. Not 100% sure tho.

	Change trade goods, particularly livestock

	I think the River Reik would enjoy being navigable, at least until Altdorf, After all after Mariengburg´s secession, the 1st Imperial Fleet is housed in its docks.

######## FUTURE STUFF #######
#############################

	Inward Perfection should scale with influence, have a lower dev cap?

	Everchosen can't get vampiric corruption?

	Less likely to implant cults if tolerance of heretics or heathens is high?

	Add way to reject being everchosen, and get some minor bonus
		Boon from your god for continuing the great game?

	Dwarves and Skaven have different underground things, or can be okay in cities
	What about terrain related maluses instead of one "above ground" penalty? Dwarves shoudn't have issues living in mountains and to a lesser degree hills. Whereas skavens would have no trouble inhabiting urban terrain.
		I think a decision to invest heavily in a province to remove the malus is a good Idea.

	When a chaos nation subject turns, it should declare independence war on its overlord

	Monstrous Military Ideas
		Just a simple military idea set, for nations that innately have monsters or evil techgroups that want to start building monsters from scratch, similarly to marine ideas force limit without having to name them individually.
		Just a idea throwup of the ordering and some kind of naming themes.
		Cossack Force Limit (0.5 per 100 development)
		Cavalry Maintenance ( Hounds of Chaos )
		10% Siege Power ( Giants at the Walls )
		Cossack Unit Fire ( Warpfire Horror Spew )
		20% force limit Expansion ( The Beastmen Wilderness )
		Garrison Attack Modifier ( Lair Nesting, useful for strong late game forts )

	Nagarythyn ideas: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1315328160153337937/1315334789133500447

	Elf culture stuff: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1314080313055510529/1315008991826546873

	I think you could Split colonial nations more. Like the Querveza (the green middle one in Lustria) could be split in 2 adding the Vampire Coast. Culchan the where the citadel of Dusk is could be split into a norther of the mountains and south of the mountains. 

	I was reviewing how we handle units and special ones in the mod. EU4 has about 15 special unit types, such as Hussars and Streltsy. Currently, we add Hussars as Grail Knights, which effectively takes up a special unit slot for Bretonnians.
		The approach I suggest is to make Hussars into something more generic, like 'Magic Cavalry,' which can then be used across different nations. We could also create a special interface in the military tab to show the current Magic Cavalry unit type for each nation.

		We can use the is_hussars_modifier = yes flag to apply different bonuses to various nations.
		like if bret you get cav shock on your Magic Cavalry
		and if wood elfs you get cavalry fire
		and the  15 special unit types would be like  Magic Cavalry,  War Machine, Monster, Monster Cavalry, Expendable Infantry
		Expendable Infantry would be cheap and we could add them for as skaven slaves,  goblins slaves

	In averlorn i´d change the Gaen Vale to farmland (or hills if you dont want to stack too much dev reduction on the province) and put the magical forest in the slopes of the Anuilli mountains

	Do we need immortal? Or just increase lifespan

	Add in Beastmen as a playable faction.

	based on stuff like the weird amount of ogres ostland has and maneaters picking up things from their parent cultures

	Gov reform that allows chaos, skaven, orcs to raize

	What about attempt to cure chaos influence for civilizations of world by building waystones?

	Decolonize Dragon isles? You could always give those dragon isle lizardmen the stateless society reform as a tribal government. Allow for them to reform into a normal nation again if they get some alternative means of directing society

	New Religion
		Vim-toism or Simcism for Nippon: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1315711285383659562/1315711285383659562

			8E and Fantasy Roleplay 4E state that Fimir are mostly concentrated in the wetlands of northern and western Old World (ie. largely concentrated in Norsca and Wastelands), but they are present elsewhere too, such as in Albion and Hybrasille (theorised to the new island shown in most recent maps of the Old World west of Albion).

#############################
######### NAH STUFF #########
#############################

Legitimate Successor government mechanic for Nehekhara & Cathay?
	Event at high legitimate successor to declare independence war? Maybe it's a defensive war to give them a chance?
	Event for the overlord to reign them in (declar war), or suffer penalty to own legitimacy
	Pretty slow moving
	Government scale for legitimate successor, with increasing diplomatic reputation and liberty desire. Higher, more liberty desire for self, less liberty desire for others.

	Generic Beacon on a Hill mission with tech difference not working

	If a Chaos tribe takes the chaos gate, they become they become everchosen?

	Give the hobgoblins fightiness?

	Change generic mission tree that gives claim rewards to be just provinces in culture group

	Should it be possible to change or have multiple racial administrations & militaries?
	To keep this balanced, either the racial admins/mils would need to be balanced with positives and negatives, or you get some broad negatives to counteract this. (like +unrest and unhappy estates for administration and -discipline for military)
	Maybe use the native religion reform mechanics for them? Aligns with slowly rebuilding/reforming the old empire
	Undead in particular is weird

A basic spell or two? Is mana = spell resource?
	Undead Spend 100 mil mana to gain a 10,000 manpower?

	Add Non-accepted culture governing cost increase back in - local_governing_cost = 1.0 ?

	Ruinous power getting great vortex should trigger an event that makes a center of reformation on the location.

	Give Estates to the Chaos Tribes - Impossible to do, native_mechanic = yes hardcodes it.

	Should all Old World Human cultures be in the same culture group?

###### Flavor Pack Ideas ######
#############################

Kislev
	Give religion a push pull between Ursun and the Ice Witches?
	Disaster for resurgance of the old ways
		Unrest and can't declare wars until it's sorted?
	Fix Icons for the ursun religion?
	Kislev: i would have put the northern territories at independent or 90%s autonomies. Especially Troll Country.
	For kislev, I would suggest an option to return to worshiping the ancient widow, possibly with some content related to the hags?
		in the original lore Thor, Dazh, and Ursun were the children of the ancient widow
		but in NuKislev the only god that gets any focus is Ursun
		to the point where their centerpiece unit is the big elemental bear

Chaos Dwarves
	Chaos dwarves - increased unrest and production from non- accepted cultures, decreased autonomy
	https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1324528741975593021/1324528741975593021
	Give Chaos Dwarves the mughal diwan ability?
	Give Chaos Dwarves that estate that taxes non-religions more. Stuff like that
	Chaos dwarves need an overhaul - industrialization and subjugation
	Hashut missions are a little strange
	Maybe fewer accepted races, but better results from them

Bretonnia
	Bret Mission problems: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1324106392189276202
	Bret Monuments
	Simplify Bret Election
	Bretonnian and their naval might. Lore wise, Bretonnia as the best navy of the human of the Old World, yet they have 0 bonus or monument to reflect the fact. 
	You dont get the united kingdom of bretonnia government reform if you form it militarily. and bretonnian duke is locked, so you cant switch manually either.


Skaven
	Betray special diplomatic action?
	Ultimate is all warp stone at a certain development for weapon of mass destruction decision to nuke enemies
	Give them access to all the diplomatic actions early
	How to make these two actions not require a diplomat?
	Form the underempire as skaven starts the vermintide, similar to everchosen mechanic

Norscans
	Change Ultimate - lame as is. Number of ships captured?
	there should probably be an option for a norscan nation to turn on the chaos gods and turn back to the old ways in a sort of challange mode since the chaosifying of norsca was a long gradual process

Chaos Tribes
	Government Type should allow estates? Make sure everybody up there is the right gov type and tech group
	Mix up the religions of the different provinces upt north

Empire
	I'm curious what the rationale is for representing Altdorf, Nuln, and Talabheim as Republics is. I know that they're "Free Cities" in Imperial parlence, but all three seem to also be hereditary monarchies. Altdorf is a principality, Talabheim a Grand Duchy, and Nuln a county.
		this is particularly strange in the case of Nuln
		as it makes there be two different Emmanuelle von Liebwitz characters
		one the feudal ruler of Wissenland, the other an elected mayor of Nuln
		when really the two should be in a personal union
	league wars between the Sigmarites and the cult of Ulric.
	Witch hunter estate for empire?
		Makes force converting people easier.
