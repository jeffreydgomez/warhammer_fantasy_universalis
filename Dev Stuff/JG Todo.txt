	non-steam needs a slightly different file structure, with the descriptor file in the mods folder alongside the mod files themselves, and a line added to point to the right directory (path="C:\Users\admin\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Europa Universalis IV\mod\warhammer_fantasy_universalis-main") but yes! works perfectly after that modification! thank you so much :)

		}

	Give the Norse Dwarves the Old Faiths religion?

	btw about gems according to the lore the dragon isles should also have a lot of gem and be a lot more jungle

	Add more options to decrease unrest, because we have so many that increase it

	Tone down all the modifiers?

	considering the warlike nature of the Greenskins, as well as the heavily war-centric playstyle that is encouraged, it would make sense to have some sort of harsh treatment cost reduction. This would be very useful to reduce the number of revolts you will be getting from all your conquests. You could also make Harsh Treatment give a small increase in Fightiness (maybe 5 per click?)

	Using the cultural unification cb for vassals?

	Add way to reject being everchosen, and get some minor bonus
		Boon from your god for continuing the great game?

	Make country, religion, and culture borders a little messier.

	Make it impossible to marry between races?

	Nurn cannot be added to the empire - It needs to be in the continent of europe to be able to. This makes it impossible to invite the southern border princes without going around through the black fire pass?

	War for karak8peaks - Clan Angrun U37 war names don't work - "No War Name"

	Monstrous Military Ideas
		Just a simple military idea set, for nations that innately have monsters or evil techgroups that want to start building monsters from scratch, similarly to marine ideas force limit without having to name them individually.
		Just a idea throwup of the ordering and some kind of naming themes.
		Cossack Force Limit (0.5 per 100 development)
		Cavalry Maintenance ( Hounds of Chaos )
		10% Siege Power ( Giants at the Walls )
		Cossack Unit Fire ( Warpfire Horror Spew )
		20% force limit Expansion ( The Beastmen Wilderness )
		Garrison Attack Modifier ( Lair Nesting, useful for strong late game forts )

	I was reviewing how we handle units and special ones in the mod. EU4 has about 15 special unit types, such as Hussars and Streltsy. Currently, we add Hussars as Grail Knights, which effectively takes up a special unit slot for Bretonnians.
		The approach I suggest is to make Hussars into something more generic, like 'Magic Cavalry,' which can then be used across different nations. We could also create a special interface in the military tab to show the current Magic Cavalry unit type for each nation.

		We can use the is_hussars_modifier = yes flag to apply different bonuses to various nations.
		like if bret you get cav shock on your Magic Cavalry
		and if wood elfs you get cavalry fire
		and the  15 special unit types would be like  Magic Cavalry,  War Machine, Monster, Monster Cavalry, Expendable Infantry
		Expendable Infantry would be cheap and we could add them for as skaven slaves,  goblins slaves

	based on stuff like the weird amount of ogres ostland has and maneaters picking up things from their parent cultures

	What about attempt to cure chaos influence for civilizations of world by building waystones?

	Add in the tall idea groups?

	Change Terrain.bmp

	Make Dwarven industrialization less punishing? allow a way to select which buff you wanna give to a province

	New Religion

	Go on a quest decision - take your ruler to a randomly set province on a different continent, maybe fight a rebel army there.

	Ask other modders (anbennar?) for 3d models?

	Some relationship between racial administration and culture of individual province?

	Reclamation of Bretonnia CB? Cut?

	Historial allies for dwarves & humans?

	Prevent everchosen from converting?

	Old Ones End Times?

	Karak Zorn flavor: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1329496919013064746\

	Add Monuments
		Also there should be various monuments in the various peaks of Vala Azril Ungol
		Shrine of Khaine as a monument?
		Oh and also I believe Black pit should be made into normal province. Since its cool place where all those huge spiders live and breed. Could possibly host two diffrent monuments even. One for goblins that use those huge spiders and commune with them to control them. 
		And the second monument or artifact could be Dark Heart. I belive i've heard somewhere that it is actually stored somwhere there. Not 100% sure tho.

Legitimate Successor government mechanic for Nehekhara & Cathay?
	Event at high legitimate successor to declare independence war? Maybe it's a defensive war to give them a chance?
	Event for the overlord to reign them in (declar war), or suffer penalty to own legitimacy
	Pretty slow moving
	Government scale for legitimate successor, with increasing diplomatic reputation and liberty desire. Higher, more liberty desire for self, less liberty desire for others.

	Generic Beacon on a Hill mission with tech difference not working

	If a Chaos tribe takes the chaos gate, they become they become everchosen?

	Give the hobgoblins fightiness?

	Change generic mission tree that gives claim rewards to be just provinces in culture group

	Should it be possible to change or have multiple racial administrations & militaries?

	To keep this balanced, either the racial admins/mils would need to be balanced with positives and negatives, or you get some broad negatives to counteract this. (like +unrest and unhappy estates for administration and -discipline for military)
	Maybe use the native religion reform mechanics for them? Aligns with slowly rebuilding/reforming the old empire
	Undead in particular is weird

A basic spell or two? Is mana = spell resource?
	Undead Spend 100 mil mana to gain a 10,000 manpower?

	Add Non-accepted culture governing cost increase back in - local_governing_cost = 1.0 ?

	Ruinous power getting great vortex should trigger an event that makes a center of reformation on the location.

	Give Estates to the Chaos Tribes - Impossible to do, native_mechanic = yes hardcodes it.

	Should all Old World Human cultures be in the same culture group?

		Absolutism Present Throughout - NOT POSSIBLE?
		Targets:
			100 = 5 at tech 3
			100 = 25 at tech 16
			100 = 100 at tech 24
		Tech 16 is start of absolutism 1610
		Tech 24 is start of age of revolutions
		An otherwise 100 absolutism person (+35) should have about 25 by the start of the age of absolutism, and 100 by the end of it
		So that’s 75 across 8 techs, meaning 10 a tech. Could be 10 a tech.

Kislev
	Give religion a push pull between Ursun and the Ice Witches?
	Disaster for resurgance of the old ways
		Unrest and can't declare wars until it's sorted?
	Fix Icons for the ursun religion?
	Kislev: i would have put the northern territories at independent or 90%s autonomies. Especially Troll Country.
	For kislev, I would suggest an option to return to worshiping the ancient widow, possibly with some content related to the hags?
		in the original lore Thor, Dazh, and Ursun were the children of the ancient widow
		but in NuKislev the only god that gets any focus is Ursun
		to the point where their centerpiece unit is the big elemental bear

Chaos Dwarves
	Chaos dwarves - increased unrest and production from non- accepted cultures, decreased autonomy
	https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1324528741975593021/1324528741975593021
	Give Chaos Dwarves the mughal diwan ability?
	Give Chaos Dwarves that estate that taxes non-religions more. Stuff like that
	Chaos dwarves need an overhaul - industrialization and subjugation
	Hashut missions are a little strange
	Maybe fewer accepted races, but better results from them

Bretonnia
	Bret Mission problems: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1324106392189276202
	Bret Monuments
	Simplify Bret Election
	Bretonnian and their naval might. Lore wise, Bretonnia as the best navy of the human of the Old World, yet they have 0 bonus or monument to reflect the fact. 
	You dont get the united kingdom of bretonnia government reform if you form it militarily. and bretonnian duke is locked, so you cant switch manually either.


Skaven
	Betray special diplomatic action?
	Ultimate is all warp stone at a certain development for weapon of mass destruction decision to nuke enemies
	Give them access to all the diplomatic actions early
	How to make these two actions not require a diplomat?
	Form the underempire as skaven starts the vermintide, similar to everchosen mechanic

Norscans
	Change Ultimate - lame as is. Number of ships captured?
	there should probably be an option for a norscan nation to turn on the chaos gods and turn back to the old ways in a sort of challange mode since the chaosifying of norsca was a long gradual process

Chaos Tribes
	Government Type should allow estates? Make sure everybody up there is the right gov type and tech group
	Mix up the religions of the different provinces upt north

Empire
	I'm curious what the rationale is for representing Altdorf, Nuln, and Talabheim as Republics is. I know that they're "Free Cities" in Imperial parlence, but all three seem to also be hereditary monarchies. Altdorf is a principality, Talabheim a Grand Duchy, and Nuln a county.
		this is particularly strange in the case of Nuln
		as it makes there be two different Emmanuelle von Liebwitz characters
		one the feudal ruler of Wissenland, the other an elected mayor of Nuln
		when really the two should be in a personal union
	league wars between the Sigmarites and the cult of Ulric.
	Witch hunter estate for empire?
		Makes force converting people easier.
