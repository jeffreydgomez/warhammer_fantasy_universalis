	non-steam needs a slightly different file structure, with the descriptor file in the mods folder alongside the mod files themselves, and a line added to point to the right directory (path="C:\Users\admin\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Europa Universalis IV\mod\warhammer_fantasy_universalis-main") but yes! works perfectly after that modification! thank you so much :)

	Chaos Warband
		Change it to normal migration stuff, we don't need all this nonsense?

	Check Barrow Legion

#############################
###### URGENT TO DOS ########
#############################

	CHORF TERRITORIES ARE STARTING WITH ENSLAVED POPULATION AND INDUSTRIAL ENSLAVEMENT

	Change the cultists in capital to have an option for no change, but reduce development - AI will choose this?

	Break up empire from the releasables.

#############################
###### RANDOM TO DOS ########
#############################

	gitignore and deletion of all those DS_Store files

	Add Vampire coast nation in Araby


	Rework Empire Mission tree for fewer imputs, and make the Southern Old World based off that.

	Bretonnia gets imperial court government reforms?

	Breaking of the Asur should be avoidable through a series of events in the first 5 years

	Ulthuan growth mission tree, if you are a subject with higher than 10 liberty desire it doesn't work

	3 new events for every culture group and religion
		Athel Loren Events to spawn chaos rebels (lure them in) in exchange for mana
		Give top level buildings
		Southern Old World
			Gain claims on all of Reme's owner's provinces or build up own capital
			we are explorers - Gain claims fair afield, or next door

	A new prophet? disaster in araby for vamprism

	Bretonnian government reforms not working

	Add more localization for ruler/country/religion/culture name

	Grail Religion should choose virtues like gods

	As Naggaroth, I conquered and released Tiranoc while they were the Phoenix King.

	Estate Privileges for converting that massively increase vs. heathens but reduce the development on conversion. Same with culture conversion cost and speed.

	Little bits of the map are available to everybody

	Should be able to vassalize enemy dominions

	Also when you abolish undead military your military tech should change from vampire count to imperial

	Allow cultural unification for your culture group or any of your subjects?

	Uzlak Canal looks crazy when moving

	No icon for industrial focus (currently a non issue, but might come up later)

	Should we disable the reform 'disable diet' for AI (set pick chance to 0) because most MTs require estates and this can lock them out of a ton of bonuses? 

	Game Crashing during end times?
		Tahmaks does not seem to cause the crash and I can still click on them as normal but even hovering my mouse over the name Garhans crashes the game
		Still somethign to do with the invisible provinces?
		Maybe the Tahmaks or Garhans are getting events that are causing the crash?
		Ask tom to console integrate the two stragglers, see what happens and if the crash occurs
		Edit the savegames (save them uncompressed) - see where the Tahmaks and Garhans are
		Maybe related to everchosen automatic expansion?
		1987 is the problem??? and 2658. Possibly 3348, 3347, and 3346?

	End Times stuff
		Bring about Ruin event has an odd goto? - All these events could use a once over
		Destroy the chaos gate decision tt is a bit confusing
		Everchosen shouldn't just eat other people's vassals
		Is the submit to everchosen event triggering somehow?
		Make sure the chaos gate adjacent provinces get actual forts too
			Make Everchosen easier? Or just a bit easier to MP?
		Two Everchosen reforms?
		
	Have all gov mechanics apply to all first rank
		Wood elf
		Lizardfolk
		Chaos

	One time important events
		Naggaroth - Taking Lothern (stepping through fire), Everqueen
		Empire - getting rid of vampires, becoming fully corrupted
		All formables?

	Gov Capacity Monument in Region for Wood Elf Monument

	For all the underempire connections, could put a single pixel of the opposing province in each connection?

	Images for "What does it mean to be ..."

	Deal with Coal

	Grimstone Pass off of bretonnian coast is bugged, can't colonize

	Reset Racial also makes all orcs aggressive? All evil aggressive?

	Tweak Rift Nations
		Stronger?
		Can't be vassalized?

	New Necromancy Religion - Like Vamprism, but doesn't spread

	Deal with Colonial Regions and Trade Companies

	Izu vision is broken somehow?

	I think the vampire faith in the mod should have the 5 bloodlines represented as sub buffs like the muslim schools in base eu4 

	Tone down monsters even more?
		Monsters - see if I can change the base cost, if that will increase maintenance

	Change Select Church Blessing image - icon_diplomacy_economy ?

	Add an Edict to reduce Devastation

	Skaeling Ideas https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1366209016690380921/1366209016690380921

	At game starting, could it be select Everchosen powerlevel? Custom settings, like antebellum?

	You should be able to dominionize other people's dominion (as long as you are not also a subject)

	Mandate of Heaven becomes mandate of the dark gods, the person who has it becomes everchosen at the start of the age?

	Should rebels give less fightiness?

	Orc annexation war events need gotos

	Add Dwarven Karaks & Underempire connection to the Mountains of Mourne
		Karaks in the Mountains of Mourne: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1355345353028796737

	New Trade stuff: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1357672541099130931

	Why do dominions not ask for independence in dominion wars?

	Not sure if bug, but also the AI seems to never pick destroy warband wargoal and thus doesn't gain warband dev

	Tilea and Esatlia re-work: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1337216951285583932

	Monstrous Military Ideas
		Just a simple military idea set, for nations that innately have monsters or evil techgroups that want to start building monsters from scratch, similarly to marine ideas force limit without having to name them individually.
		Just a idea throwup of the ordering and some kind of naming themes.
		Cossack Force Limit (0.5 per 100 development)
		Cavalry Maintenance ( Hounds of Chaos )
		10% Siege Power ( Giants at the Walls )
		Cossack Unit Fire ( Warpfire Horror Spew )
		20% force limit Expansion ( The Beastmen Wilderness )
		Garrison Attack Modifier ( Lair Nesting, useful for strong late game forts )

	I was reviewing how we handle units and special ones in the mod. EU4 has about 15 special unit types, such as Hussars and Streltsy. Currently, we add Hussars as Grail Knights, which effectively takes up a special unit slot for Bretonnians.
		The approach I suggest is to make Hussars into something more generic, like 'Magic Cavalry,' which can then be used across different nations. We could also create a special interface in the military tab to show the current Magic Cavalry unit type for each nation.

		We can use the is_hussars_modifier = yes flag to apply different bonuses to various nations.
		like if bret you get cav shock on your Magic Cavalry
		and if wood elfs you get cavalry fire
		and the  15 special unit types would be like  Magic Cavalry,  War Machine, Monster, Monster Cavalry, Expendable Infantry
		Expendable Infantry would be cheap and we could add them for as skaven slaves,  goblins slaves

	based on stuff like the weird amount of ogres ostland has and maneaters picking up things from their parent cultures

	What about attempt to cure chaos influence for civilizations of world by building waystones?

	Add in the tall idea groups?

	Change Terrain.bmp

	Make Dwarven industrialization less punishing? allow a way to select which buff you wanna give to a province

	New Religion
		Vim-toism or Simcism for Nippon: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1315711285383659562/1315711285383659562
		Add Cult of Sotek: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1316218273985200221/1316218273985200221
	
	Go on a quest decision - take your ruler to a randomly set province on a different continent, maybe fight a rebel army there.

	Karak Zorn flavor: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1329496919013064746\

	Add Monuments
		Also there should be various monuments in the various peaks of Vala Azril Ungol
		Shrine of Khaine as a monument?
		Oh and also I believe Black pit should be made into normal province. Since its cool place where all those huge spiders live and breed. Could possibly host two diffrent monuments even. One for goblins that use those huge spiders and commune with them to control them. 
		And the second monument or artifact could be Dark Heart. I belive i've heard somewhere that it is actually stored somwhere there. Not 100% sure tho.

		What I would love to see is the Slayer temple as a monument. It amazes me that the main temple of grimnir isn't in the game.

Legitimate Successor government mechanic for Nehekhara & Cathay?
	Event at high legitimate successor to declare independence war? Maybe it's a defensive war to give them a chance?
	Event for the overlord to reign them in (declar war), or suffer penalty to own legitimacy
	Pretty slow moving
	Government scale for legitimate successor, with increasing diplomatic reputation and liberty desire. Higher, more liberty desire for self, less liberty desire for others.

	Generic Beacon on a Hill mission with tech difference not working

	If a Chaos tribe takes the chaos gate, they become they become everchosen?

	Give the hobgoblins fightiness?

	Change generic mission tree that gives claim rewards to be just provinces in culture group

	Should it be possible to change or have multiple racial administrations & militaries?

	To keep this balanced, either the racial admins/mils would need to be balanced with positives and negatives, or you get some broad negatives to counteract this. (like +unrest and unhappy estates for administration and -discipline for military)
	Maybe use the native religion reform mechanics for them? Aligns with slowly rebuilding/reforming the old empire
	Undead in particular is weird

A basic spell or two? Is mana = spell resource?
	Undead Spend 100 mil mana to gain a 10,000 manpower?

	Add Non-accepted culture governing cost increase back in - local_governing_cost = 1.0 ?

	Ruinous power getting great vortex should trigger an event that makes a center of reformation on the location.

	Give Estates to the Chaos Tribes - Impossible to do, native_mechanic = yes hardcodes it.

	Should all Old World Human cultures be in the same culture group?

		Absolutism Present Throughout - NOT POSSIBLE?
		Targets:
			100 = 5 at tech 3
			100 = 25 at tech 16
			100 = 100 at tech 24
		Tech 16 is start of absolutism 1610
		Tech 24 is start of age of revolutions
		An otherwise 100 absolutism person (+35) should have about 25 by the start of the age of absolutism, and 100 by the end of it
		So that’s 75 across 8 techs, meaning 10 a tech. Could be 10 a tech.

###### Flavor Pack Ideas ######
#############################

Kislev
	Give religion a push pull between Ursun and the Ice Witches?
	Disaster for resurgance of the old ways
		Unrest and can't declare wars until it's sorted?
	Fix Icons for the ursun religion?
	Kislev: i would have put the northern territories at independent or 90%s autonomies. Especially Troll Country.
	For kislev, I would suggest an option to return to worshiping the ancient widow, possibly with some content related to the hags?
		in the original lore Thor, Dazh, and Ursun were the children of the ancient widow
		but in NuKislev the only god that gets any focus is Ursun
		to the point where their centerpiece unit is the big elemental bear

Chaos Dwarves
	Chaos dwarves - increased unrest and production from non- accepted cultures, decreased autonomy
	https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1324528741975593021/1324528741975593021
	Give Chaos Dwarves the mughal diwan ability?
	Give Chaos Dwarves that estate that taxes non-religions more. Stuff like that
	Chaos dwarves need an overhaul - industrialization and subjugation
	Hashut missions are a little strange
	Maybe fewer accepted races, but better results from them

Bretonnia
	Bret Mission problems: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1324106392189276202
	Bret Monuments
	Simplify Bret Election
	Bretonnian and their naval might. Lore wise, Bretonnia as the best navy of the human of the Old World, yet they have 0 bonus or monument to reflect the fact. 
	You dont get the united kingdom of bretonnia government reform if you form it militarily. and bretonnian duke is locked, so you cant switch manually either.


Skaven
	Betray special diplomatic action?
	Ultimate is all warp stone at a certain development for weapon of mass destruction decision to nuke enemies
	Give them access to all the diplomatic actions early
	How to make these two actions not require a diplomat?
	Form the underempire as skaven starts the vermintide, similar to everchosen mechanic

Norscans
	Change Ultimate - lame as is. Number of ships captured?
	there should probably be an option for a norscan nation to turn on the chaos gods and turn back to the old ways in a sort of challange mode since the chaosifying of norsca was a long gradual process

Chaos Tribes
	Government Type should allow estates? Make sure everybody up there is the right gov type and tech group
	Mix up the religions of the different provinces upt north

Empire
	I'm curious what the rationale is for representing Altdorf, Nuln, and Talabheim as Republics is. I know that they're "Free Cities" in Imperial parlence, but all three seem to also be hereditary monarchies. Altdorf is a principality, Talabheim a Grand Duchy, and Nuln a county.
		this is particularly strange in the case of Nuln
		as it makes there be two different Emmanuelle von Liebwitz characters
		one the feudal ruler of Wissenland, the other an elected mayor of Nuln
		when really the two should be in a personal union
	league wars between the Sigmarites and the cult of Ulric.
	Witch hunter estate for empire?
		Makes force converting people easier.

	Summon the elector counts decision, with trigger able options to help out electors for IA!
	Elector counts estate for Emperor!
	Expand empire diplomatically? Can it be done?
	More imperial Authority earned? - Will happen naturally through Balkanization

Vampires
	Reviving Vlad events for Sylvania. 	for Sylvania is there any way like event or anything to get that bald pretender Manfred off the throne and get Vlad and his lady back on?

Brettonia
	jeff you should add a debuff for the developpement for bretonia

Wood Elves
	knowing this. What do you think of a conection between the Oak of Ages and the Gaen Vale as in the world roots, perhaps unlockable through a mission (like you do with Eordand or Cyranvar in Anbennar)
	"Canals" from the Oak to other places


Dark Elf
	Also, Naggarond shouldn't be single nation, no? Maybe it should be vassal swarm where vassal can declare war on other vassal, but must participate in their overlord wars? And until Malekith don't capture Phoenix Throne, he would be unable to integrate them. 
	Unique ship units instead of flagship for black ships?


High Elves
	Sword of Khaine Disaster
