	non-steam needs a slightly different file structure, with the descriptor file in the mods folder alongside the mod files themselves, and a line added to point to the right directory (path="C:\Users\admin\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Europa Universalis IV\mod\warhammer_fantasy_universalis-main") but yes! works perfectly after that modification! thank you so much :)

	Force religion on colony

	Minor question, but is it possible to downgrade a vassal to a dominion?

	Hey. The region of the sea that is currently called Gulf of Naggaroth is called the Sea of Malice and the portion of water between Naggaroth and Ulthuan is called the Sea of Chaos not the Sea of Feuds

	As a beastmen stan, sad my boy Khazrak isnt playable.

	Offer vassalization to dominions through the normal means?

	Nurn cannot be added to the empire - It needs to be in the continent of europe to be able to. This makes it impossible to invite the southern border princes without going around through the black fire pass?

	Two popups for ending the end times https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1315782027534008420/1317095941404229662

    Make it so that Implant cult can only target capitals if they are the only possible province

	I know its a minor detail but elves in Warhammer fantasy on avaradge live to 1000 years without the aid of magical means. (My guy is 985 so no problem for me but just something): https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1314656598051913818/1317188732939669657

	Event for the reciever of the orc/skaven city raiding mission

	The norscan tribe gov-reform doesn't operate for Kurgan Culture, so is instantly suspended, however switching to the Tribes of Chaos would also mean you lose all your current territory and become migratory.

	Could force raiding for AI allied with Players in a war, but that feels kinda cheaty. Maybe if they have a certain amount of trust?

	Final Empire Centralization reform doesn't work!
	
	As Etaine I colonized some provinces in Dawn's Light (Equivalent to South Africa) but can't add them to a trade company. For references, I have all DLCs.

	i dont think its possible to pass the reforms without fighting all the electors: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1314656598051913818/1316839640489263136

	Events for Skaven nand orcs - bored war party - mneightbors get rebels (and you get opinion modifier), or you get rebels

	The Nehekharan Pantheon should have a decision you can take every so often which allows you to switch which diety you follow, since your rulers are immortal you're locked in unless you choose to get them killed
		Based on Norsca?

	War for karak8peaks - Clan Angrun U37 war names don't work - "No War Name"

	is a dominion meant to cost twice as much AE as non-dominions?

	At start of end times all good nations like each other more

	Khorne Sacrifice events and decisions working?

	Raid Neighbors Wood Elf Mission
		Correct me if i'm wrong but this was implemented with all provinces scope and checked for neighbor provinces when it could be scoped directly to neighbors, couldn't it?

	Expand empire diplomatically? Can it be done?

	More imperial Authority earned? - Will happen naturally through Balkanization

	It doesn't seem to go through if you full annex a race, and I would also suggest promoting a culture should work in place of trust but that's just me.

	Gell's suggested flavor decisions/events: https://discord.com/channels/@me/1315325752035770490/1315327269371379712

	Trade Stuff
		https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1323475506829590591

	Add Monuments
		Also there should be various monuments in the various peaks of Vala Azril Ungol
		Bretonnia has only one monument as well, I would have at least expected a vinyard or the like, or a port that buffs up their navy to reflect the lore of them having a really damn strong navy
		Bordeleaux should have either a port or a vinyard, and Moussilion is think would probbaly deserve a monument as well
		Shrine of Khaine as a monument?
		Oh and also I believe Black pit should be made into normal province. Since its cool place where all those huge spiders live and breed. Could possibly host two diffrent monuments even. One for goblins that use those huge spiders and commune with them to control them. 
		And the second monument or artifact could be Dark Heart. I belive i've heard somewhere that it is actually stored somwhere there. Not 100% sure tho.

######## FUTURE STUFF #######

	Combine a lot of the grouped mission modifiers

	Make Hashut a Dwarf Religion, not Chaos?

	Everchosen can't get vampiric corruption?

	Less likely to implant cults if tolerance of heretics or heathens is high?

	I think the River Reik would enjoy being navigable, at least until Altdorf, After all after MariengburgÂ´s secession, the 1st Imperial Fleet is housed in its docks.

	Add way to reject being everchosen, and get some minor bonus
		Boon from your god for continuing the great game?

	Brets start with punishing serfdom noble privelage

	Everyone gets a peasants estate?

	Monstrous Military Ideas
		Just a simple military idea set, for nations that innately have monsters or evil techgroups that want to start building monsters from scratch, similarly to marine ideas force limit without having to name them individually.
		Just a idea throwup of the ordering and some kind of naming themes.
		Cossack Force Limit (0.5 per 100 development)
		Cavalry Maintenance ( Hounds of Chaos )
		10% Siege Power ( Giants at the Walls )
		Cossack Unit Fire ( Warpfire Horror Spew )
		20% force limit Expansion ( The Beastmen Wilderness )
		Garrison Attack Modifier ( Lair Nesting, useful for strong late game forts )

	Nagarythyn ideas: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1315328160153337937/1315334789133500447

	I think you could Split colonial nations more. Like the Querveza (the green middle one in Lustria) could be split in 2 adding the Vampire Coast. Culchan the where the citadel of Dusk is could be split into a norther of the mountains and south of the mountains. 

	Change some HRE localization: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1319451494877102170/1319451494877102170

	Reclaim Mordhein decision: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1316417937241935882/1316417937241935882

	I was reviewing how we handle units and special ones in the mod. EU4 has about 15 special unit types, such as Hussars and Streltsy. Currently, we add Hussars as Grail Knights, which effectively takes up a special unit slot for Bretonnians.
		The approach I suggest is to make Hussars into something more generic, like 'Magic Cavalry,' which can then be used across different nations. We could also create a special interface in the military tab to show the current Magic Cavalry unit type for each nation.

		We can use the is_hussars_modifier = yes flag to apply different bonuses to various nations.
		like if bret you get cav shock on your Magic Cavalry
		and if wood elfs you get cavalry fire
		and the  15 special unit types would be like  Magic Cavalry,  War Machine, Monster, Monster Cavalry, Expendable Infantry
		Expendable Infantry would be cheap and we could add them for as skaven slaves,  goblins slaves

	In averlorn iÂ´d change the Gaen Vale to farmland (or hills if you dont want to stack too much dev reduction on the province) and put the magical forest in the slopes of the Anuilli mountains

	Do we need immortal? Or just increase lifespan

	Add Faceting and other events that change the price of goods

	Add in Beastmen as a playable faction.

	Necromancer and Vampire nations should be able to create set armies by decision/spell (if spell system is ever added) from nothing

	Decision for Greenskin and Skaven administrations to raid own lands!

	based on stuff like the weird amount of ogres ostland has and maneaters picking up things from their parent cultures

	Gov reform that allows chaos, skaven, orcs to raize

	What about attempt to cure chaos influence for civilizations of world by building waystones?

	Decolonize Dragon isles? You could always give those dragon isle lizardmen the stateless society reform as a tribal government. Allow for them to reform into a normal nation again if they get some alternative means of directing society

	kislev cav is so dirt cheap lmao, I has it as same cost of infantry within the first 20 years

	New Religion
		Vim-toism or Simcism for Nippon: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1315711285383659562/1315711285383659562

			8E and Fantasy Roleplay 4E state that Fimir are mostly concentrated in the wetlands of northern and western Old World (ie. largely concentrated in Norsca and Wastelands), but they are present elsewhere too, such as in Albion and Hybrasille (theorised to the new island shown in most recent maps of the Old World west of Albion).

	Request to seize arifacts from colony and possibly gift artifacrs?

	Decision to get Nagash as a ruler
	
	Go on a quest decision - take your ruler to a randomly set province on a different continent, maybe fight a rebel army there.

	Ask other modders (anbennar?) for 3d models?

	Make Everchosen A Theocracy to make it stickier?

	"Canals" from the Oak to other places

	Add 3 advisors gfx per race + 1 female one

	Add Panama Canal

	Disaster and event series for high elves to unify and fight off invaders if they land in ulthuan. number of provinces owned by a nation not of the right religion or culture.
		Or just an event that encourages high elves to do it - if you declar war, you get prestige and more trust and love with everybody else on the island.

	End Times Drama
		Being next to the everchosen (or any chaos dude) makes rebels spawn in that province?

	Make various diplomatic actions cause a pop-up for the receiver. And offers?
		Offer to become dominion action?
		Pop up when you can vassalize dominions (Doesn't work)
		Convert Them

	Some relationship between racial administration and culture of individual province?

	Add the warhammer legendary lords into the map, with legendary traits

	Make end times start a country event, not a province event

	Use on-actions to Tie administration & mil to primary culture

	Intolerant, with decision to get rid of it

	Make all the tech ground and administration & military stuff come from primary culture?

	Norsca Nation can choose to civilize

	Send raiding party ability to lose manpower, damage relationship, and spawn a rebel army in an adjacent country

	Fightiness events that give manpower don't give manpower if you're already above max? They give mil power or something else?

	Add some islands? Increase colonial range?

#############################
######### NAH STUFF #########
#############################

Legitimate Successor government mechanic for Nehekhara & Cathay?
	Event at high legitimate successor to declare independence war? Maybe it's a defensive war to give them a chance?
	Event for the overlord to reign them in (declar war), or suffer penalty to own legitimacy
	Pretty slow moving
	Government scale for legitimate successor, with increasing diplomatic reputation and liberty desire. Higher, more liberty desire for self, less liberty desire for others.

	Generic Beacon on a Hill mission with tech difference not working

	If a Chaos tribe takes the chaos gate, they become they become everchosen?

	Give the hobgoblins fightiness?

	Change generic mission tree that gives claim rewards to be just provinces in culture group

	Should it be possible to change or have multiple racial administrations & militaries?
	To keep this balanced, either the racial admins/mils would need to be balanced with positives and negatives, or you get some broad negatives to counteract this. (like +unrest and unhappy estates for administration and -discipline for military)
	Maybe use the native religion reform mechanics for them? Aligns with slowly rebuilding/reforming the old empire
	Undead in particular is weird

A basic spell or two? Is mana = spell resource?
	Undead Spend 100 mil mana to gain a 10,000 manpower?

	Add Non-accepted culture governing cost increase back in - local_governing_cost = 1.0 ?

	Ruinous power getting great vortex should trigger an event that makes a center of reformation on the location.

	Give Estates to the Chaos Tribes - Impossible to do, native_mechanic = yes hardcodes it.

	Should all Old World Human cultures be in the same culture group?

#############################
###### Flavor Pack Ideas ######
#############################

Kislev
	Give religion a push pull between Ursun and the Ice Witches?
	Disaster for resurgance of the old ways
		Unrest and can't declare wars until it's sorted?
	Fix Icons for the ursun religion?
	Kislev: i would have put the northern territories at independent or 90%s autonomies. Especially Troll Country.
	For kislev, I would suggest an option to return to worshiping the ancient widow, possibly with some content related to the hags?
		in the original lore Thor, Dazh, and Ursun were the children of the ancient widow
		but in NuKislev the only god that gets any focus is Ursun
		to the point where their centerpiece unit is the big elemental bear

Skaven
	Betray special diplomatic action?
	Ultimate is all warp stone at a certain development for weapon of mass destruction decision to nuke enemies
	Give them access to all the diplomatic actions early
	How to make these two actions not require a diplomat?
	Form the underempire as skaven starts the vermintide, similar to everchosen mechanic

Norscans
	Change Ultimate - lame as is. Number of ships captured?
	there should probably be an option for a norscan nation to turn on the chaos gods and turn back to the old ways in a sort of challange mode since the chaosifying of norsca was a long gradual process

Chaos Tribes
	Government Type should allow estates? Make sure everybody up there is the right gov type and tech group
	Mix up the religions of the different provinces upt north

Empire
	I'm curious what the rationale is for representing Altdorf, Nuln, and Talabheim as Republics is. I know that they're "Free Cities" in Imperial parlence, but all three seem to also be hereditary monarchies. Altdorf is a principality, Talabheim a Grand Duchy, and Nuln a county.
		this is particularly strange in the case of Nuln
		as it makes there be two different Emmanuelle von Liebwitz characters
		one the feudal ruler of Wissenland, the other an elected mayor of Nuln
		when really the two should be in a personal union
	league wars between the Sigmarites and the cult of Ulric.
	Witch hunter estate for empire?
		Makes force converting people easier.

	knowing this. What do you think of a conection between the Oak of Ages and the Gaen Vale as in the world roots, perhaps unlockable through a mission (like you do with Eordand or Cyranvar in Anbennar)

Dark Elf
	Also, Naggarond shouldn't be single nation, no? Maybe it should be vassal swarm where vassal can declare war on other vassal, but must participate in their overlord wars? And until Malekith don't capture Phoenix Throne, he would be unable to integrate them.

	Hashut missions are a little strange
		Maybe fewer accepted races, but better results from them
	Should be handing out grudge negative opinion modifier like candy through events

	Tension between the Nekeharan Pantheon and Nagashi
	Nagashi religion to ressurect Nagash

Orcs/Greenskin
	5 pulse events to move towards mork or gork

	Gork interaction: more manpower and gold
	Make the fightiness AI choose nobody if every neighboring is at least 2x stronger than them. Should add a little fightiness.
