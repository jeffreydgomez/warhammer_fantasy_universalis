	non-steam needs a slightly different file structure, with the descriptor file in the mods folder alongside the mod files themselves, and a line added to point to the right directory (path="C:\Users\admin\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Europa Universalis IV\mod\warhammer_fantasy_universalis-main") but yes! works perfectly after that modification! thank you so much :)

###### RANDOM TO DOS ########
#############################

	Before Kislev, Mage's Estate
		Humans, Elves, 

	Uniform regulations and New Draperies triggering multiple times?
		Only as Greenskin? Is it related to the 0 =, becuase these are event 0 ids?
		Make the Orc fightiness pulse only trigger if they have certain amounts of fightiness or something?
		Maybe it's the dummy event?
		Or it's unrelated to that and just when you get a high enough tech?

	Should skaven be able to industrialize? Probably!

	Survey land yielding the same result every time?

	Make the legendary traits more expensive for custom nations

	And declare on them if it gets about 100?

	Make end times easier?

	New images for new Government

	Change End Times events for good folks to be on an on-action trigger, possibly 1/year, maybe even more than that

	Kislev - more foreign cultures

	Redo Bretonian election stuff

	Assassination avilable if you complete the espionage idea group

	Figured out the problem - even if adjacent, you can't add the dwarf tunnel provinces to the empire, so vassals in those mountains can't join

	I plan on adding one fimir and one beastmen nation per continent to make this more achievable.
		https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1346542362897154138/1346542362897154138

	What do you think of giving Kislev Tsardom goverment? Or is there reason why it isnt there?
		I think they should have a mechanic were you have to favor Ungols or Gospodars

	Cultural Perfection privilege for many races that gives bonuses in same culture group, penalties in non same culture group? Or just higher tolerance in same religion, fewer accepted cultures.

	Make Dwarven industrialization less punishing? allow a way to select which buff you wanna give to a province

	Change Ka Sabar starting situation: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1341095345551048774

	Add a little fightiness when a province is taken

	Give Mandate of Heaven to Cathay

	Streltsy for heroic units

	Give Lizardfolk a 5 year spawning event that affects manpower?

	Walking through the fire event chain for High Elves

	Make mountains and mountain passes different

	Other privileges like the Necrotect Monsers to others

	Change some of those uncoloznied urban to non-urban https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1339918809997250610

	All the prosperity stuff requires mandate of heaven! Give another option there?

	High Elf events for Everqueen moods: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1341738762316808246

	More Skaven Underempire connections (Albion, Naggaroth, Mountains of Mourne)

	Add more regions to have possible trade companies: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1324122490632536166
		As Etaine I colonized some provinces in Dawn's Light (Equivalent to South Africa) but can't add them to a trade company. For references, I have all DLCs.

	Also why doesnt Ulthuan (tag) not have a Gov reform? Like even just Asur Kingdom is fine for a stopgap.

	Force religion on colony

	As a beastmen stan, sad my boy Khazrak isnt playable.

	It's a fort in an adjacent province in the underempire problem? Perhaps dwarves get vision on all underempire exits and entrances. Or, when adjacent or at war they do? People with their capitals in the underemprie get vision on all underempire exits and entrances

	Monster adjustments: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1322572062916870144. Reduce reinforcement speed

	Black Corn resource in skaven

	Araby Changes: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1338854508721344554

	Different local cultures should have benefits in different terrain, allowing for interesting movement. This is on top of administration issues.

	Make hated races or events? Is this unnecessary?

	Weird glitchiness when council is completely dead.
		Maybe if the council controller is the pope when they are dead, then a new council controller is given to the owner of skavenblight?
			This could be an event for the owner of skavenblight

	Starting Localization or events about Kislev

	Change ulthuan flag: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1318955446697988126/1319193642317119550

	The "Resurrect Strygos" decision doesn't work for the Sires of Mourkain.

	Dwarven Scism for new ideas: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1329741080182390877

	Make it impossible to marry between races

	Offer vassalization to dominions through the normal means?

	Nurn cannot be added to the empire - It needs to be in the continent of europe to be able to. This makes it impossible to invite the southern border princes without going around through the black fire pass?

	Two popups for ending the end times https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1315782027534008420/1317095941404229662

	War for karak8peaks - Clan Angrun U37 war names don't work - "No War Name"

	At start of end times all good nations like each other more?

	Mix up Tilean Governments: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1316226022504402965/1316226022504402965

	Many more cultures! Double the number of cultures in each culture group.

	Add way to reject being everchosen, and get some minor bonus
		Boon from your god for continuing the great game?

	Dwarves and Skaven have different underground things, or can be okay in cities
		What about terrain related maluses instead of one "above ground" penalty? Dwarves shoudn't have issues living in mountains and to a lesser degree hills. Whereas skavens would have no trouble inhabiting urban terrain.

	When a chaos nation subject turns, it should declare independence war on its overlord

	Monstrous Military Ideas
		Just a simple military idea set, for nations that innately have monsters or evil techgroups that want to start building monsters from scratch, similarly to marine ideas force limit without having to name them individually.
		Just a idea throwup of the ordering and some kind of naming themes.
		Cossack Force Limit (0.5 per 100 development)
		Cavalry Maintenance ( Hounds of Chaos )
		10% Siege Power ( Giants at the Walls )
		Cossack Unit Fire ( Warpfire Horror Spew )
		20% force limit Expansion ( The Beastmen Wilderness )
		Garrison Attack Modifier ( Lair Nesting, useful for strong late game forts )

	Nagarythyn ideas: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1315328160153337937/1315334789133500447

	Elf culture stuff: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1314080313055510529/1315008991826546873

	I was reviewing how we handle units and special ones in the mod. EU4 has about 15 special unit types, such as Hussars and Streltsy. Currently, we add Hussars as Grail Knights, which effectively takes up a special unit slot for Bretonnians.
		The approach I suggest is to make Hussars into something more generic, like 'Magic Cavalry,' which can then be used across different nations. We could also create a special interface in the military tab to show the current Magic Cavalry unit type for each nation.

		We can use the is_hussars_modifier = yes flag to apply different bonuses to various nations.
		like if bret you get cav shock on your Magic Cavalry
		and if wood elfs you get cavalry fire
		and the  15 special unit types would be like  Magic Cavalry,  War Machine, Monster, Monster Cavalry, Expendable Infantry
		Expendable Infantry would be cheap and we could add them for as skaven slaves,  goblins slaves

	based on stuff like the weird amount of ogres ostland has and maneaters picking up things from their parent cultures

	Gov reform that allows chaos, skaven, orcs to raize

	What about attempt to cure chaos influence for civilizations of world by building waystones?

	Add in the tall idea groups?

	New Religion
		Vim-toism or Simcism for Nippon: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1315711285383659562/1315711285383659562

	Add Nations
		Boris Ursus' faction from the Chaos Wastes
		Add Skarbrand and Exhiles of Khorne. And Kuâ€™gath
		A lost legion of curious geaser on Albion
	
	Go on a quest decision - take your ruler to a randomly set province on a different continent, maybe fight a rebel army there.

	Ask other modders (anbennar?) for 3d models?

	Fix Monstrous costs - No idea
		Cossacks w/ land_maintenance_modifier = 2.0
			Costs 10
			Says 0.66/month
			Actual 1.98/month

		Cossacks w/ nothing
			Costs 10
			Says 0.22/month

		Cossacks w/ global_regiment_cost = 1.0
			Costs 10
			Says 0.22/month
			Actual 0.22/mont

		Normal units
			Costs 10
			Says 0.22/month
			Acual 0.22/month

	Add Panama Canal

	Make various diplomatic actions cause a pop-up for the receiver. And offers?
		Offer to become dominion action?
		Pop up when you can vassalize dominions (Doesn't work)
		Convert Them

	Some relationship between racial administration and culture of individual province?

	Add the warhammer legendary lords into the map, with legendary traits

	Make end times start a country event, not a province event

	Reclamation of Bretonnia CB? Cut?

	Norsca Nation can choose to civilize

	Add some islands? Increase colonial range?

	Give Orcs monsters?

	Everchosen cannot convert?

	Event chains that are resurections of historic figures

	Estates to speed up slow down seasons

	Automatic Raid Coast?

	Make orc trade more garbage?

	Abolition of slavery act

	Disaster for realizing that the Lady of the Lake is an Elven God

	Why is Gorfang Rotgut not leading Black Crag and instead it Grimgor?. Grimgor He should be thrown into the east.

	Historial allies for dwarves & humans?

	K8P Balance - Give various factions +/- manpower or gold

	Prevent everchosen from converting?

	Old Ones End Times?

	Should Celestial Regency use EOC? Or High Elves?

	Karak Zorn flavor: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1329496919013064746\

	Add Monuments
		Also there should be various monuments in the various peaks of Vala Azril Ungol
		Shrine of Khaine as a monument?
		Oh and also I believe Black pit should be made into normal province. Since its cool place where all those huge spiders live and breed. Could possibly host two diffrent monuments even. One for goblins that use those huge spiders and commune with them to control them. 
		And the second monument or artifact could be Dark Heart. I belive i've heard somewhere that it is actually stored somwhere there. Not 100% sure tho.

		What I would love to see is the Slayer temple as a monument. It amazes me that the main temple of grimnir isn't in the game.

Legitimate Successor government mechanic for Nehekhara & Cathay?
	Event at high legitimate successor to declare independence war? Maybe it's a defensive war to give them a chance?
	Event for the overlord to reign them in (declar war), or suffer penalty to own legitimacy
	Pretty slow moving
	Government scale for legitimate successor, with increasing diplomatic reputation and liberty desire. Higher, more liberty desire for self, less liberty desire for others.

	Generic Beacon on a Hill mission with tech difference not working

	If a Chaos tribe takes the chaos gate, they become they become everchosen?

	Give the hobgoblins fightiness?

	Change generic mission tree that gives claim rewards to be just provinces in culture group

	Should it be possible to change or have multiple racial administrations & militaries?
	To keep this balanced, either the racial admins/mils would need to be balanced with positives and negatives, or you get some broad negatives to counteract this. (like +unrest and unhappy estates for administration and -discipline for military)
	Maybe use the native religion reform mechanics for them? Aligns with slowly rebuilding/reforming the old empire
	Undead in particular is weird

A basic spell or two? Is mana = spell resource?
	Undead Spend 100 mil mana to gain a 10,000 manpower?

	Add Non-accepted culture governing cost increase back in - local_governing_cost = 1.0 ?

	Ruinous power getting great vortex should trigger an event that makes a center of reformation on the location.

	Give Estates to the Chaos Tribes - Impossible to do, native_mechanic = yes hardcodes it.

	Should all Old World Human cultures be in the same culture group?

###### Flavor Pack Ideas ######

Kislev
	Give religion a push pull between Ursun and the Ice Witches?
	Disaster for resurgance of the old ways
		Unrest and can't declare wars until it's sorted?
	Fix Icons for the ursun religion?
	Kislev: i would have put the northern territories at independent or 90%s autonomies. Especially Troll Country.
	For kislev, I would suggest an option to return to worshiping the ancient widow, possibly with some content related to the hags?
		in the original lore Thor, Dazh, and Ursun were the children of the ancient widow
		but in NuKislev the only god that gets any focus is Ursun
		to the point where their centerpiece unit is the big elemental bear

Chaos Dwarves
	Chaos dwarves - increased unrest and production from non- accepted cultures, decreased autonomy
	https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1324528741975593021/1324528741975593021
	Give Chaos Dwarves the mughal diwan ability?
	Give Chaos Dwarves that estate that taxes non-religions more. Stuff like that
	Chaos dwarves need an overhaul - industrialization and subjugation
	Hashut missions are a little strange
	Maybe fewer accepted races, but better results from them

Bretonnia
	Bret Mission problems: https://discord.com/channels/1314079561687896084/1324106392189276202
	Bret Monuments
	Simplify Bret Election
	Bretonnian and their naval might. Lore wise, Bretonnia as the best navy of the human of the Old World, yet they have 0 bonus or monument to reflect the fact. 
	You dont get the united kingdom of bretonnia government reform if you form it militarily. and bretonnian duke is locked, so you cant switch manually either.


Skaven
	Betray special diplomatic action?
	Ultimate is all warp stone at a certain development for weapon of mass destruction decision to nuke enemies
	Give them access to all the diplomatic actions early
	How to make these two actions not require a diplomat?
	Form the underempire as skaven starts the vermintide, similar to everchosen mechanic

Norscans
	Change Ultimate - lame as is. Number of ships captured?
	there should probably be an option for a norscan nation to turn on the chaos gods and turn back to the old ways in a sort of challange mode since the chaosifying of norsca was a long gradual process

Chaos Tribes
	Government Type should allow estates? Make sure everybody up there is the right gov type and tech group
	Mix up the religions of the different provinces upt north

Empire
	I'm curious what the rationale is for representing Altdorf, Nuln, and Talabheim as Republics is. I know that they're "Free Cities" in Imperial parlence, but all three seem to also be hereditary monarchies. Altdorf is a principality, Talabheim a Grand Duchy, and Nuln a county.
		this is particularly strange in the case of Nuln
		as it makes there be two different Emmanuelle von Liebwitz characters
		one the feudal ruler of Wissenland, the other an elected mayor of Nuln
		when really the two should be in a personal union
	league wars between the Sigmarites and the cult of Ulric.
	Witch hunter estate for empire?
		Makes force converting people easier.

Vampires
	Reviving Vlad events for Sylvania. 	for Sylvania is there any way like event or anything to get that bald pretender Manfred off the throne and get Vlad and his lady back on?
	Have a Vampiric mission create a center of reformation

Brettonia
	jeff you should add a debuff for the developpement for bretonia
	Add Chevaliers de Lyonesse
	Brets start with punishing serfdom noble privelage

Wood Elves
	knowing this. What do you think of a conection between the Oak of Ages and the Gaen Vale as in the world roots, perhaps unlockable through a mission (like you do with Eordand or Cyranvar in Anbennar)
	"Canals" from the Oak to other places


Dark Elf
	Also, Naggarond shouldn't be single nation, no? Maybe it should be vassal swarm where vassal can declare war on other vassal, but must participate in their overlord wars? And until Malekith don't capture Phoenix Throne, he would be unable to integrate them. 
	Unique ship units instead of flagship for black ships?


High Elves
	Sword of Khaine Disaster

		Can't stop using while at war
